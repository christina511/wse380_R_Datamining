"1253465","CAREER: Towards HCI Theory for Technical and Gender Identity","IIS","Information Technology Researc, CHS-Cyber-Human Systems","02/01/2013","09/21/2017","Jennifer Rode","PA","Drexel University","Continuing grant","Ephraim Glinert","01/31/2019","$316,559.00","","jennifer.a.rode@drexel.edu","1505 Race St, 10th Floor","Philadelphia","PA","191021119","2158955849","CSE","1640, 7367","1045, 1640, 7367, 9251, CL10","$0.00","The PI's long-term goal is to create theory to inform HCI design practices, to ensure the production of egalitarian designs that reflect all users' values.  In particular, she aims to create feminist theory for HCI , which she hopes will close the gap in women's participation in computing.  Previously, the PI has shown how approaches to designing for women are questionable when viewed in light of feminist theory.  Feminist scholars argue that the lack of women in computing further discourages women from pursuing programming-related careers, and that women are also excluded because technologies created by men better address male needs.  The PI believes the problem lies not only in who is excluded but in that the design processes inherently alienate women.  Her approach is to address the problem by bridging previously unrelated aspects of the learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and the science and technology studies of gender, which will be combined with findings from a multi-year ethnographic study to acquire a deep understanding of how girls co-construct their gender and technical identities, how technologies come to be associated with one gender or the other, and how this affects girls' career choices. These results will be used as the basis for participatory design with the girls to create technologies in keeping with their gender identity.  In doing so the PI expects to learn about girls' needs, enabling her to develop best practices for gender-sensitive design ensuring equitable access to technology.  By bridging previously unconnected literatures, the project will reframe the problem of gender-equity in computer science from a pipeline issue to one requiring improved design and evaluation practices in HCI.  The multi-year ethnographic study, to be conducted both in school and at after school programs, will provide a longitudinal understanding of how young women co-construct their gender and technical identities, what appeals to them about technical careers, and the process by which technology artifacts acquire symbolic gender.  Participatory design will allow theory to be applied to understand what appeals to girls in the technology design process.  While the project is not itself an education intervention, by building on both the empirical and theoretical contributions this research will explore how design practices themselves can be used to increase female participation in computing.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  This research will directly impact women's training in computing, as well as lead to changes in the design process to be more inclusive for women. The project will create grounded theory on gender and technical identity that will inform participatory design, which in turn will allow the identification of needed changes to the software development process so that it results in more technologies that empower young women to use technology.  As a consequence, the pool of qualified computer scientists will ultimately expand to include more women, which in the long turn will increase workforce thereby making the United States more globally competitive in business and more able to pursue scientific national security efforts.  Furthermore, the project will directly benefit the group of young women involved in the ethnographic study, increasing their practical experiences with technology by teaching them software design, HCI, programming skills, and a foundation in computational thinking.  Through participatory design the project will also expose middle and high school teachers to ubiquitous computing technologies, providing teacher development."

Similarly, human-computer interaction (HCI) methods, despite considerable research efforts, remain dominated by the traditional keyboard and mouse.  Improving HCI is a critical area of need, especially for individuals with disabilities who find traditional methods cumbersome (at best) or unusable (at worst).  The rapid development of radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies holds the potential to significantly advance current challenges in both gesture recognition and HCI.  Advantages of RFID approaches include miniaturization of passive tags, the ability to safely implant tags, and the potential to remotely track multiple tags; these characteristics combine to support the definition, recognition, and development of interfaces based on (tagged) human movements, or gestures.  The PI's goal in this project is to explore RFID solutions for the most challenging gesture recognition and HCI applications, including complex gesture recognition and effective computer interfaces for individuals with severe motor impairments.  These objectives will be realized through a series of coordinated research, development, and evaluation efforts.  First, RFID localization algorithms will be developed utilizing harmonic radar approaches and implemented using modified commercially available components; this approach will yield significantly higher resolution than current power loss techniques, and will be capable of tracking multiple tags in cost-effective implementations.   Next, implementations for small and large workspace will be carried out.  The small workspace implementation will address tongue-based HCI for individuals with severe disabilities, while the large workspace implementation will be used for hand gesture recognition and computer control.  Finally, the algorithms, hardware, and implementations will be rigorously evaluated for fundamental accuracy, application performance, and user efficacy.  Fundamental accuracy evaluations will characterize the performance and limits of spatial-temporal RFID tag tracking, while HCI and gesture recognition capabilities will be assessed through application performance and user efficacy evaluations.  <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  This research addresses fundamentally important interface and communications issues faced by individuals with disabilities, and will include direct programmatic involvement by individuals with disabilities.  Project outcomes will afford individuals with disabilities more effective interfaces and greater communications capabilities, thereby providing greater independence and, ultimately, improved social, educational, and economic opportunities.  In achieving these objectives, the project will lay the foundation for a fundamentally new approach to capturing, characterizing, and exploiting human movement for HCI and gesture recognition applications.  The results will have significant impact beyond the targeted applications, for instance in animal studies, human performance studies, and even security (e.g., monitoring fine movements of objects)."

The goal of this project is to guide further development of sustainable HCI by informing research in the area with an understanding of contemporary interventionist eco-art practices. By ""interventionist eco-art practices"" we are referring to a set of artists and projects that combine public and institutional engagement with a commitment to sustainability, to produce artifacts and systems that intervene in environmental issues to raise awareness and provide models for social change. Through such activities, artists push the boundaries of how we use and think about technology and its relationship to the environment. These interventionist eco-art artists and projects suggest new themes and work practices that could usefully inform sustainable HCI. But because they are born from far outside of the traditional sciences, arts-based approaches run into challenges in being taken up and taken seriously as part of HCI. On the one hand, methods and outcomes deriving from the arts are most easily incorporated into HCI by retro-fitting them to existing understandings of HCI as a scientific discipline in ways that blunt their potential to truly add new perspectives. On the other hand, methods and outcomes that remain true to an arts sensibility can suffer marginal status as ""artsy HCI"" such arts-based approaches are more likely to be considered acceptable for fringework or one-off systems than to be thought of as appropriate or essential for the core research of HCI.

As computers become smaller, faster, and more ubiquitous, our ability to use them effectively becomes critical.  Not only must we design usable systems, but we must do so in a rapidly changing landscape of computing hardware that includes desktops, mobile phones, and embedded systems.  A unique aspect of HCI is that it requires the study of not just computing, but of the combination of computing and people.  Because people are involved, HCI is a field where aspects such as culture, socio-economic background, gender, etc., are considered in the systems that we build.  This is a clear argument for the development of a diverse field of researchers who bring to bear a wide range of experiences in their problem solving skills.<br/><br/>This is funding to provide partial support for the CHIMe 2010 workshop, which will bring together approximately 40 students and 10 distinguished speakers from academia and industry as part of the Discipline-specific Mentoring Workshops sponsored in part by CRA (http://www.cra-w.org/cdc).  The PIs, who were co-chairs of the Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference this past year, have put together a program that consists of presentations, panels, and a poster session designed to inform, inspire, and encourage our future scientists.  Workshop speakers will include leading researchers in the field, who will address a broad range of issues ranging from technical concerns (such as appropriate evaluation methods) to some of today's hot topics.  The workshop will be collocated with the ACM 2010 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2010), which will be held April 10-15 in Atlanta, and is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human-Computer Interaction (SIGCHI); this is the leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of research and practice relating to human-computer interaction, and is attended by approximately 2,500 HCI professionals from around the world.  The workshop is advertised on the CHI 2010 Conference website as a ""Hosted Event.""  Workshop sponsors currently include the CDC/CRA-W and EL Alliance, and the PIs are soliciting additional funding from industry.  NSF funds will be used to cover the travel costs of 9 non-local students to participate in the event.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The PIs have made a serious and successful effort to attract participants from HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities), HSI (Hispanic-Serving Institutions), ACU (Appalachian Colleges and Universities), and TCU (Tribal Colleges and Universities) institutions.  CHIMe 2010 will harness the cumulative experience of successful STEM professionals in the field to provide a unique forum in which to showcase the technical achievements of diverse researchers in computing and to encourage a new generation of researchers from underrepresented groups.  With its focus on graduate students in HCI, the workshop will be positioned to have a direct impact on future faculty and researchers in this area of endeavor.  It will provide a highly technical and supportive environment for underrepresented minority doctoral students in the field of HCI to discuss their research and to receive constructive feedback from experts, along with an opportunity for networking and peer mentoring."

This is the leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of human-computer interaction (HCI) research and practice, and is attended by approximately 2,500 HCI professionals from around the world.  Research reports published in the CHI Conference Proceedings and the CHI Extended Abstracts are heavily-refereed and widely cited; they are among the most scientifically respected and impactful research publications in the field of HCI.  More information about the conference is available at http://www.chi2010.org. <br/><br/>The Doctoral Consortium is a research-focused meeting that has taken place annually at the CHI conference since 1986, and has helped to launch the careers of many outstanding HCI researchers.  Goals of the workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the research field give them advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference.  Student participants will make formal presentations of their research during the workshop, and will receive feedback from the faculty panel.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  Student participants will present their work to the doctoral consortium on April 10-11, with follow up activities planned during the technical program of the conference.  Extended abstracts of the students' work will be published in the CHI 2010 Extended Abstracts, which has wide print and electronic distribution.  SIGCHI's conference management committee will evaluate the doctoral consortium, and the results will be made available to the organizers of future consortia.

Because the students and faculty constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, including nationality/cultural and scientific discipline, the students' horizons are broadened to the future benefit of the field.  In an effort to further broaden the impact of the event, the organizers have undertaken to use NSF funds to support participation by no more than one student from any one institution.  They will try explicitly to identify and include the broadest possible group of highly-qualified participants, and in particular will consider gender in the participant selection process with a target of a 50/50 split."

This research hypothesizes that Human Computer Interaction (HCI) has much to offer ICT for development (ICT4D), but the methods and techniques also require customization to address the unique challenges of the developing world. The result of this proposed research will be an explanation of the methods and techniques of Human-Computer Interaction for Development (HCI4D), highlighting similarities and differences to HCI. It will do so through establishing a relationship with a partner institution in Africa, identified through a survey of tertiary Computing education in Africa. Joint with this institution, an HCI4D project intervention will be identified.<br/><br/>First and foremost this proposed research seeks to begin the process of creating an awareness of and a research agenda around the methods necessary to conduct HCI4D. Successful HCI4D interventions have the possibility of broadening the global Information Society to include those least served by ICTs. By making it possible for more people to interact with computers, this proposed research seeks to change technologically mediated human-human interaction, bringing an increasingly diverse population into the global society?supporting an increased range of interactions and cultures online. By examining the methods, and identifying differences between HCI4D and HCI, this proposed research also supports introspection of the values and assumptions held in techniques generated by and in use in the developed world.<br/><br/>This research expands the discipline of HCI into a new domain, the developing world. Results have much to contribute to the understanding of the values and assumptions built into existing methods.

Computer scientists design algorithms, interfaces, interactions, specifications, programs, systems and simulations.  The studio method of instruction is prevalent in the preparation of professionals within a variety of other design disciplines, such as architecture and industrial design.  Although a few innovative computer science programs have implemented the studio method, and the logistics and procedures involved have been well-documented, little is known about which components of the studio experience are critical to successful outcomes.  Research on effective learning strategies and the characteristics of innovative work groups could further illuminate the group processes and classroom environment that contribute to successful design studio experiences.  We have much to gain by examining techniques that are effective in the preparation of other designers in order to strengthen the preparation of computer science professionals who are capable of meeting the critical software design challenges of the 21st century.  Toward this end, the PIs will leverage knowledge about design education from architecture and industrial design, to develop new educational models and materials for the design of software-intensive systems, specifically in the area of Human Computer Interaction (HCI).  In the first two years of the project the PIs will focus on research involving data collection and analysis to examine in detail the impact of the studio method on how students learn HCI design.  The data analysis will be informed by the literature on cognitive apprenticeship teaching methods and characteristics of innovative work groups, in order to illuminate the group processes and environment that contribute to successful outcomes within design studio experiences.  Through an investigation of the design process used within an interdisciplinary studio-based project and HCI courses that incorporate a modified studio method, the PIs will formulate guidelines for implementing the studio method in HCI courses and will derive principles that can be applied to the education of future computer science professionals.  In the third year, the effectiveness of the curriculum guidelines will be evaluated through pilot testing in HCI classrooms, and revised based on the results of the formative evaluation.  Research outcomes and curriculum guidelines will be disseminated through presentations, publications, and a project web site.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  Based on an investigation of factors that contribute to creative group processes and products within an academic design studio environment, the PIs will advance software design research and education through the development of new models and methods that are supported by empirical evidence and that are teachable.  In this way, the PIs will develop a strong intellectual foundation for teaching software design, which has the potential to transform the teaching of HCI, and ultimately for improving the processes of constructing, evaluating, and modifying software-intensive systems across a variety of computer science specialty areas."

The annual CHI conference is the leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of human-computer interaction (HCI) research and practice, and is attended by approximately 2,500 HCI professionals from around the world.  Research reports published in the CHI Conference Proceedings and the CHI Extended Abstracts are heavily-refereed and widely cited; they are among the most scientifically respected and impactful research publications in the field of HCI.  CHI 2012 will focus on the centrality of experience, from the models, theories and practical insights needed to understand and design for user experience to the irreplaceable value of experiencing innovation in the HCI field through hands-on interactivity.  More information about the conference is available at http://chi2012.acm.org.<br/><br/>The Doctoral Consortium is a research-focused meeting that has taken place annually at the CHI conference since 1986, and has helped to launch the careers of many outstanding HCI researchers.  Goals of the workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the research field give them advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference.  Student participants will make formal presentations of their research during the workshop, and will receive feedback from the faculty panel.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.

This Partnership for Innovation Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) collaborative project tackles the impending threats to humanity of illiteracy and faltering education heads-on by creating a new smart-service human-computer interface (HCI) neurotechnology platform as a highly effective, user-friendly, and fun-to-use tool aiding learning and stimulating cognitive development at home and in the classroom.  The immersive HCI neurotechnology will allow directly measuring progress at the cognitive level and providing real-time feedback to guide the user in learning to read more effectively.  The project is highly Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) intensive both in its activities and in the targeted benefits of the developed technology, which extends directly to learning science and mathematics by probing cognitive performance of children while they solve puzzles.  The development of unobtrusive neurotechnology further addresses a critical need for practical integrated and modular brain-computer interface (BCI) solutions in HCI promoting widespread consumer and clinical use in the marketplace.  The partnership provides opportunities for students to gain practical experience in innovation in the marketplace through internships with the industrial partners.<br/><br/>The central aim is to develop and leverage new HCI technology as a learning coach and personal cognitive development assistant that facilitates learning to read and acquiring other critical skills in cognitive development.  The immersive yet unobtrusive HCI technology testbed will comprise a dry-electrode electroencephalography (EEG) BCI, a tablet with touchscreen and integrated camera, and a suite of signal processing algorithms running in the cloud, for monitoring brain and gaze activity in children learning to read, and providing real-time neurofeedback on progress in cognitive performance to promote enhanced learning.  The partnership will transition scientific advances of a previous NSF-sponsored UCSD project (NSF EFRI-M3C, ENG-1137279) in studying the distributed dynamics of human motor control, to development of neurofeedback training paradigms for learning enhancement, and to practical deployment on the unobtrusive immersive testbed implemented using Cognionics dry-electrode EEG wireless BCI neurotechnology and Syntrogi real-time cloud-based signal processing software pipelines.  The potential for human empowerment by the technology will be demonstrated by evaluating effectiveness in enhancing learning capabilities and cognitive performance in simulated classroom settings and other targeted learning environments.<br/><br/>The lead institution for the project is University of California San Diego (UCSD), with investigators from the Institute for Neural Computation and Department of Bioengineering.  The industrial partners in the effort are Syntrogi Inc. (dba Qusp, small business, San Diego CA) and Cognionics, Inc. (small business, San Diego, CA).  The project also engages broader context partners Drs. Andrea Chiba and Leanne Chukoskie from the UCSD Temporal Dynamics of Learning Center, Dr. Barbara Moss from San Diego State University Department of Psychology, and Dr. Zewelanji N. Serpell from Virginia Commonwealth University Department of Psychology, in the human case studies and the assessment of the developed HCI technology in diverse learning environments."

Students are provided with classroom training and gain hands-on research experience using cutting-edge instruments, equipment, computers and technological infrastructure. Classes in computer programming and graphics,  interface design, human computer interaction, and ethics occupy approximately 35% of the students'time. For the remaining time, students conduct interdisciplinary research projects in groups of three. Each group interacts with graduate students in the Human Computer Interaction Graduate Program under the supervision of HCI faculty. The research projects are presented at an end-of-the summer campus- wide research symposium in the form of posters, demos, and a five-page research paper.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit    <br/>Two major trends are driving research in Emerging Interface Technologies: a dramatic increase and cheapening of interface technologies themselves, and the ubiquitous permeation of technology into everyday lives. Correspondingly, research questions focus on what new interfaces can be designed and on people's perception, conceptualization, and usage of these interfaces. The SPIRE exposes studentsto four broad areas of EIT: information visualization, mobile/ubiquitous interfaces, intelligent agents, and enabling infrastructure. Because SPIRE-EIT has arisen from the ISU HCI graduate program, with 72 faculty across ISU's seven disciplinary colleges, faculty members compete to have their research projects included in the SPIRE and cite strong benefits from participation afterwards.    <br/><br/>Broader Impact    <br/>As knowledge work and adaptability to new technologies continue to drive global competitiveness, it is imperative for the US to maintain leadership in interdisciplinary technology-based research and training.  ISU's HCI graduate program was developed in response to this need, and represents an ideal platform to host SPIRE-EIT. Both the HCI program and SPIRE-EIT recruit with an emphasis on underrepresented groups, preparing students for graduate education in the interdisciplinary area of HCI, an area of importance to the US economy. By including instruction on ethics and on research-based evaluation techniques, the SPIRE gives students skills that are useful lifelong, independent of discipline, and which students might not otherwise encounter in a traditional engineering or computer science curriculum.  Because of the connection with HCI, the results of research projects can easily be incorporatedinto faculty members' undergraduate and graduate classes. Professionally, the SPIRE offers an impressivementoring experience for the participants because of the large number of graduate student mentors involved. The experience offers these mentors, in turn, an opportunity to practice mentoring for when they become faculty."

As computers become smaller, faster, and more ubiquitous, our ability to use them effectively becomes critical.  Not only must we design usable systems, but we must do so in a rapidly changing landscape of computing hardware that includes desktops, mobile phones, and embedded systems.  A unique aspect of HCI is that it requires the study of not just computing, but of the combination of computing and people.  Because people are involved, HCI is a field where aspects such as culture, socio-economic background, gender, etc., are considered in the systems that we build.  This is a clear argument for the development of a diverse field of researchers who bring to bear a wide range of experiences in their problem solving skills.<br/><br/>This is funding to provide partial support for the Computer-Human Interaction Mentoring (CHIMe) 2012 workshop http://chime.hci.cs.vt.edu, which will bring together approximately 67 students and 10 distinguished speakers from academia and industry as part of the Discipline-specific Mentoring Workshops sponsored in part by the BPC Alliance of CRA-W http://www.cra-w.org and CDC (the Coalition to Diversify Computing http://cdc-computing.org).   This is the second offering of the CHIMe Workshop, whose goal is to provide an opportunity for networking and mentoring among students in the field of HCI who belong to one or more of the following communities: women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities.  The workshop will be run as a series of presentations and panels; speakers will include leading researchers in the field drawn, to the extent they were available, from these same communities, who will address a broad range of issues ranging from technical concerns (such as appropriate evaluation methods) to some of today's hot topics.  The speakers' diverse occupations in government labs, academia and industry will provide attendees with different perspectives of the field.  The workshop will be collocated with and listed as an offering on the website of the ACM 2012 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2012), which will be held May 5-10 in Austin, Texas, and is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human-Computer Interaction (SIGCHI); this is the leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of research and practice relating to human-computer interaction, and is attended by approximately 2,500 HCI professionals from around the world.  NSF funds will cover the costs of approximately 25 student participants; additional funds are being provided by CDC/CRA-W and Microsoft Corporation.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The PIs have made a serious and successful effort to attract participants from HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities), HSI (Hispanic-Serving Institutions), ACU (Appalachian Colleges and Universities), and TCU (Tribal Colleges and Universities) institutions.  CHIMe 2012 will harness the cumulative experience of successful STEM professionals in the field to provide a unique forum in which to showcase the technical achievements of diverse researchers in computing and to encourage a new generation of researchers from underrepresented groups.  With its focus on graduate students in HCI, the workshop will be positioned to have a direct impact on future faculty and researchers in this area of endeavor.  It will provide a highly technical and supportive environment for underrepresented minority doctoral students in the field of HCI to discuss their research and to receive constructive feedback from experts, along with ample opportunities for networking and peer mentoring."

The intrinsic high energy density present in an HCI-solid impact, where a reproducible quantum mechanical state of a highly ionized atom transfers energy into a solid at atomic length scales, gives irradiance values (~1014 W/cm2) that rival those achievable with petawatt lasers (~7x1011 W/cm2) and that can be obtained and maintained more easily than a laser.  Understanding the physical mechanisms that control how an HCI can deliver this energy to a target is the primary and open question of materials research that will be addressed.  With this instrumentation we will be able to create HCIs of a selected charge state and impact them onto well-defined targets where secondary electron, X-ray, and mass loss sensing will be used for real-time analysis and precisely timed clocking (via X-ray deexcitation) of impact events.  In doing so, we will probe the complex interplay between fundamental atomic physics (X-ray emissions, Rydberg atom formation, etc.) and energy dissipation that is the defining characteristic of HCI-materials interactions.  Results obtained with this beamline will be directly applied to the use of HCIs in electronic device processing as well as the evaluation of candidate materials for fusion reactor walls, the role of HCIs in astrophysically relevant ion-target impact conditions, and the accelerated spaceflight-readiness testing of electronics devices and materials.  This instrumentation will be housed on the central campus of Clemson University, will be operated by a trained staff technician, and will be maintained through the committed and combined support of the College of Engineering and Science and the university.   The core investigators and management team will utilize this acquisition to enhance our outreach programs to women and minorities through established programs on campus and through our existing connection with South Carolina State University.<br/><br/>Non-Technical Summary:  <br/><br/>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br/><br/>We propose the acquisition of a highly charged ion (HCI) beamline for interdisciplinary materials research and education at Clemson University.  Highly charged ions, which are atoms stripped of a large fraction of their electrons, are unique as they possess a high energy density that can lead to novel HCI-solid interactions not typically encountered in a materials laboratory environment. Our goals with this acquisition are to explore the physical mechanisms that control how a HCI can deliver energy to a target and apply that knowledge to the development of HCIs as a processing tool for electronic materials fabrication.  In addition, the inherent presence of HCIs in fusion reactors, a candidate technology for clean energy production, as well as in the space environment makes this acquisition a prime tool for reproducing these conditions in a laboratory setting.  Operating as a research laboratory and user facility for the study of HCI interactions with materials, this beamline will open new doors to a multitude of researchers and encourage their explorations into this unique form of matter.  The incorporation of cryogen-free technologies for the production of HCIs into this proposed acquisition ensures that it will function as a low cost, single-operator beamline that has a low threshold for user and collaborator participation. This instrumentation will be housed on the central campus of Clemson University, will be operated by a trained staff technician, and will be maintained through the committed and combined support of the College of Engineering and Science and the university.   The core investigators and management team will utilize this acquisition to enhance our outreach programs to women and minorities through established programs on campus and through our existing connection with South Carolina State University."

With twelve faculty members in the area and state-of-the-art facilities and equipment, Virginia Tech's Center for HCI is a leader in the development of new interfaces and in the education of scientists and engineers who will build and use them. Building on a long and rich history of undergraduate research, the PIs and affiliated faculty seek to engage students from regional schools in research endeavors-particularly those from schools that traditionally cater to women and underrepresented minorities. Four regional schools (with whom the group has partnered on other efforts) serve as partner institutions on this proposal, hosting visits and open house events to encourage their students to attend the program. At least ten students are involved during the eight-week summer program, with the goal of providing the students with a broad look at the discipline of HCI and an in-depth experience conducting research with experienced faculty on the latest technology-ultimately leading to an informed decision to further their education with a graduate degree from Virginia Tech or elsewhere. The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit<br/>The proposed work will advance the field of HCI through the integration of unique opinions of a diverse population. The discipline of HCI is highly interdisciplinary, drawing success from the melding of computer science, industrial and systems engineering, psychology, sociology, computer engineering, architecture, art, and more-all fields in which the faculty listed on this proposal have recent or ongoing projects. By drawing upon the strengths at regional universities and leveraging the unique experiences of populations typically not adequately represented in computer science or HCI, the project will significantly advance interface development for emerging technologies.<br/><br/>Broader impact<br/>Central to this proposal is the teaching, training, and learning for an emerging group of leaders in HCI. Particularly important is participation of under-represented groups: women and minorities at colleges lacking the research programs and infrastructure present at Virginia Tech. The proposal leverages several recent enhancements to the resources and infrastructure at our university-many funded by the NSF-by building and enhancing external partnerships. As the program grows and matures, a diverse and well-trained set of new leaders in research will emerge from Virginia Tech."

A large number of biological signal sensors will be integrated for the purpose of developing HCI with the ability to respond to the state of the user's autonomic nervous system (including user emotion and affect, and states related to exercise and health). Affective computing implies that a computer system should be able to assess the emotional state of the subject, i.e., perform affective sensing based on real-time monitoring of the physiological expression of the user's affective state. Non-invasive/unobtrusive measurements in this monitoring process ultimately yield enhancements in HCI. Physiological manifestations of sympathetic activation associated with affective shifts in a highly integrated sensory platform may reveal inconspicuous but relevant features that could be overlooked when the signals are observed in isolation. The work involves five sets of experiments:<br/>-DSP for affective sensing,<br/>-Real-time measurement of eye gaze tracking,<br/>-Analysis of the relationship between exercise and blood volume, <br/>-EEG as a way to assess the quality of HCI, and<br/>-Autonomic nervous system monitoring as a way to assess HCI.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: This affective sensing system can be used as an evaluation platform toward the design of the next generation of human computer interfaces that would improve access and functional capabilities of persons with disabilities. The development of the instrument will impact the training and motivation of future professionals and researchers.

The idea was to teach the audience how to be knowledgeable in the methods with which they did not have deep experience, enough so that they could judge whether a research paper using that method was done well or not.  The attendees rated most of these tutorials as excellent, and urged the organizers to find a way to make their content available to more people.<br/><br/>This is funding to support the video recording and distribution of five of these tutorials on the topics of ""Design Research,"" ""Large Data Set Analysis,"" ""Ethnography,"" ""Content and Conversation Analysis,"" and ""Crowdsourcing.""

In addition, the talks will be professionally transcribed to serve as first drafts of chapters in a timely and much-needed book tentatively entitled ""Handbook of Methods for HCI.""<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  This effort will expose a substantial number of people to new and sophisticated methods for investigating how people interact with computing.  The video tutorials on the Web and the book to follow will enable researchers and students everywhere to learn some of the latest, state-of-the-art methods, which they can then exploit in their research."

How does the QWERTY keyboard perform in communities whose language has no ""Q"", ""W"", ""E"", ""R"", ""T"", nor ""Y""? What is the point of a personal computer in a context where technologies are not held for a person but are shared by a whole community? Computer applications and PC appliances have traditionally been designed by and for Western high-income populations. But today the Internet and internet-enabled computers have become a truly global phenomenon reaching out to many of the most remote and marginalized communities. The User Centered Design and International Development workshop that the PI is organizing will be held on Saturday, April 28, in cooperation with the ACM 2007 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 07) in San Jose. This is an official workshop of the CHI 07 conference. The workshop will explore interaction design in the context of international development, and in particular will address interaction design for parts of the world that are often marginalized by current systems and applications designers. The PI believes that to extend the boundaries of existing practice in designing information and communication technologies, their design should be with, for, and of the marginalized communities he plans to set centre stage in the workshop discussions. The workshop will provide a forum to exchange experiences, explore differences between developed and developing world contexts, develop new partnerships, and learn from each other's experiences. NSF funding will enable approximately ten international participants to attend from low-income countries, from which participation would otherwise be impossible.<br/><br/>The annual CHI conference, sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (ACM SIGCHI), is a leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of human-computer interaction (HCI) research and practice. It is attended by approximately 2,400 HCI professionals from around the world. Research papers presented at the conference are heavily-refereed and widely cited; they constitute some of the most scientifically respected research publications in the field of HCI.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: A review of the HCI literature exposes the broad intellectual gap that exists between problems of computer interaction and studies of the development impact of computer technologies in low-income countries. By assembling together many of the world leaders in these two disciplines for the first time, the PI expects that this workshop will be instrumental in creating an epistemic community and developing intellectual momentum around these topic areas (the PI reports that he has already have been overwhelmed with over 60 submissions from around the world). Outcomes from the workshop will be reported in the journal Information Technology and International Development; additionally, the PI expects to publish a workshop summary in a leading HCI journal such as Interactions, and possibly also to hold a follow-on workshop at the CHI 08 conference."

The investigators plan to produce guidelines to help designers of problem-based software environments make design decisions that account for gender differences.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project lies in the potential contribution to human computer interface research. The topic of gender barriers in software design merits significant study. The project has thus has the potential to make a significant contribution to human computer interface and software design research as well as to provide insight into the barriers and possible solutions to the under-representation issues in information technology.<br/><br/>The project promotes broader impacts in several ways. The investigation team is composed primarily of females and three female high school students are involved in the research, which may encourage more female participation in information technology. The investigators plan to translate the empirical results of the study into a set of model-based guidelines to be widely distributed to software developers. If implemented, the resulting software could be instrumental in removing software-related gender differences that will result in broader participation in information technology careers by females.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Students will initially investigate in-vehicle speech interactions to establish how different speech recognition error rates and different response times affect the driver. Students will subsequently contrast interacting with a computer to interacting with a passenger. Finally, students will use the results of these experiments to propose new, safer approaches to driver-computer spoken interactions. In the context of speech interactions with public displays, students will explore the use of pupil diameter measurements from video camera based eye trackers to estimate the cognitive load associated with spoken interactions with electronic bulletin boards. Students will develop techniques for separating pupil diameter changes that are due to cognitive load from those that are due to visual target luminance on the display. Students will subsequently use pupil diameter to evaluate the cognitive load associated with different types of interactions with public displays, providing a baseline for proposing novel interactions that mix spoken and manual interactions. <br/><br/>Non-technical description.<br/>The UNH IRES program is a cooperative effort between the University of New Hampshire and the University of Stuttgart in Germany.

The HCI Lab is one of the leading ubicomp laboratories in the world. <br/>Student research within the UNH IRES program will focus on two areas: in-vehicle speech interaction and speech interaction with public displays. In the automotive domain, speech interaction with in-vehicle devices is an important topic. In-vehicle devices, such as built-in entertainment systems, and brought-in mobile phones, are proliferating, and research has shown that it can be dangerous to interact with these devices by touching and/or looking. Thus, much research has been done to explore speech as an alternative way of interaction with in-vehicle devices. Students in the UNH IRES program will relate the benefits and limitations of speech interaction with in-vehicle devices with real-world parameters, such as how well speech recognition works at any given moment. They will also work to identify why it is that talking to a passenger appears to reduce the probability of a crash, and how we might be able to use this new information to create safer in-vehicle speech interactions.<br/>Speech interaction is also an exciting topic in the budding exploration of electronic bulletin boards. Today, people use bulletin boards to display and read printed (physical) notices. But tomorrow?s electronic bulletin boards will act more like large, public webpages, edited by users from their mobile phones. Students in the UNH IRES program will compare speech interaction with other types of interactions with such electronic bulletin boards (such as typing directly on the bulletin board, or typing on a mobile phone). They will pay special attention to assessing the mental effort of each type of interaction. Their long-term goal will be to assess if speech interaction can reduce this mental effort."

The project's core aim is to design, implement, and evaluate several new HCI features for clinical decision support (CDS) systems that have the potential for directly impacting point-of-care treatment and improving care for patients suffering from long-term illness. Some of the primary HCI features proposed include: 1) Visually enhanced interactive functions for EHR systems such as treatment trend maps and data indicators, 2) Patient data summary of critical data elements in a dashboard format, 3) Access to evidence-based recommendations relevant to individual patients, and, 4) Display of co-morbid conditions explicitly to encourage review and analysis in the context of routine patient care.  The proposed work will explore the use of visual analytics to process patient and comparative population medical profile data to generate data summaries in the form of interactive visualizations (data views). The data views will be designed to provide physicians with the capability to filter patient data based on key data elements such as medications and co-morbid conditions, and to compare patient treatment trends with established evidence-based guidelines to identify treatment gaps and options. As part of the usability evaluation, the proposed work will engage end-users (i.e., care providers) directly in requirement generation, implementation, evaluation, and refinement of the CDS HCI.  The broad impact of the proposed work include disseminating the outcome and findings through the network of Clinical Translational Science Awardees (60 academic medical centers) that are involved in developing novel informatics solutions to accelerate the translation of medical treatments and prevention strategies.   Additionally, the MindsEye software will be distributed with appropriate documentation to contribute to health IT education and training and to spur practical IT engagements and new research activities."

But while a participant's medical condition can be referred to using consistent medical terminology, for HCI the name of a given condition provides only a vague estimate of the functional capabilities of the individual. Numerous articles have been published where participants were described as having multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, or cervical spinal cord injuries, but such clinical diagnoses provides insufficient insights into the capabilities of the study participants. In this research, the PI will take the first steps towards the development of consistent assessment tools for measurement of the functional capabilities of research participants, which address the needs of the HCI research community with respect to describing a subject cohort with functional impairments for a given study. The PI envisions such assessment tools being used to measure both applicable human functions (seeing, hearing, physical movement and manipulation, and cognition) and standard HCI functions (inputs such as pointing, text entry and speech input, and outputs such as visual display, text-to-speech output amd audio display). The tools would be designed for use in any study which involved HCI and people with disabilities, and could also be used to assess people who experience situational limitations which occur not because of medical causes but due to the environment (cold, heat, wind, brightness, darkness, etc) or the task (carrying things, eyes-busy, audio occluded or precluded, etc). In this exploratory study, the PI will focus on one set function, namely physical interactions with computers, for which he will develop two proof-of-concept solutions. First, a questionnaire-based functional assessment will be developed, by bringing together existing knowledge on the assessment of physical functions and IT interactions. This tool will be evaluated by accessibility researchers, followed by a controlled experiment that will allow for formal validation as well as a demonstration of the tool's practicality. Second, to demonstrate the potential of computer-based functional assessments, the PI will develop a hardware and software tool that provides detailed quantitative functional assessments for selected movement and dexterity impairments, including those which are voluntary (e.g., reduced fine motor control) and involuntary (e.g., tremors, dystonia, myoclonus). This tool, to comprise standard and customized computer hardware as well as custom software, will allow for more detailed assessments than the paper-based tool. Again, tool efficacy will be demonstrated through a controlled experiment.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This research focuses on the challenges experienced by individuals with various disabilities as they interact with information technologies. The outcomes of the project will allow the capabilities of study participants to be described independent of any underlying clinical diagnosis, while providing greater detail regarding their IT-related capabilities. As a result, the resulting techniques will enhance our ability to interpret results reported in the literature, and will also allow results to be compared among studies more effectively. Future extensions of this research may facilitate the matching of IT users to specific technologies, and also assist hardware and software developers to develop products that either adapt to the needs of individual users or are usable by people with a wide variety of functional limitations."

This project starts with the recognition that we must substantially rethink our relationship to the environment. The project develops an understanding of the marginal ties of this particular community to an industrialized consumer culture to highlight the aspects of everyday IT design which are predicated on industrialized orientations such as mass production and consumption of consumer goods and a disconnect with the natural environment. In response to this understanding, a design case book is developed to reflect a sustainable approach to human-computer interaction (HCI).

By making it seem as if sharing is the norm -- after all, your friends are doing it -- the designer signals to the end-user that he can and should participate and share information. This research focuses on two broad themes: what are the effects of design choices on changing what users think is appropriate to share and with whom? and how do norms interact with design to impact these decisions? Understanding how disclosure decisions are made and manipulated is critical as corporate and individual interests can be quite different. This is because norm-shaping can be used for benevolent purposes, such as guiding the end-user through an unfamiliar interface, but can also be used to manipulate the end-user and cause him or her to share information he or she would have preferred to keep private. The fact that such design patterns can be used both ways makes them particularly interesting: the user has no way of inferring the designer's intent, and policy makers and well intentioned designers have no mechanism for assessing the norm-shaping properties of their design choices. This research contributes to the development of tools to study user interfaces as embodiments of social norms as well as contributing more broadly to the discourse of privacy and sharing online.<br/><br/>The specific research goals are to (a) identify design patterns that shape disclosure norms, (b) experimentally determine the mechanisms by which they work (e.g., how patterns modify perception of norms and thus behavior), and (c) integrate these observations into existing theoretical frameworks (e.g., the ""privacy calculus"") that model how disclosure decisions are made.  The PIs plan to use experiments to identify the impact of design on the perception of social norms and subsequent information divulging behavior. The experiments combine methodologies from experimental economics with Human Computer Interaction (HCI) methods. Additionally, the PIs will test econometrically an extension of the privacy calculus model that includes a preference for norm compliance, estimating an individual's willingness to trade-off between privacy preserving behavior and compliance with sharing norms. This research will  demonstrate how tools from different disciplines can be used to enhance understanding of design in privacy and HCI. The results would feed back to the privacy, economics, and HCI communities."

To advance the state of user interfaces (UI) and create more adaptive interaction modalities, the foundational knowledge regarding human-cyber interaction (HCI) must incorporate more neuro-physiological evidence.  The project proposes a three-step plan for attaining this advance. First, three experimental subject groups will be carefully selected and recruited for comparative analysis: 1) healthy and young adults 2) demented or near-demented older adults, and 3) adults suffering from mild brain trauma. Second, experimental sessions will be conducted based on incrementally complex information searching and messaging tasks that require executing the tasks inside an MRI machine. <br/><br/>The goal of the experimental phase is to collect neuronal activation patterns using fMRI, as well as behavioral data associated with response time and accuracy.  Third, the experimental findings will be analyzed to establish potential association among neuronal evidence, behavior, and UI performance.  The broad technical aim of the initiative is to establish and refine methods for gathering neuro-physiological evidence under complex HCI conditions, and develop new user modeling techniques for supporting flexible and effective interaction.  Development of advanced user interfaces capable of monitoring and establishing risk factors associated with impending or existing brain-degenerative conditions is a longer term translational aim. The resources and outcomes produced will be broadly shared among scholars in computer and information science disciplines, with the aim of promoting and supporting training of next-generation HCI researchers."

Papadopoulos<br/>Tulane University<br/><br/>This is an exploratory grant for which the hypotheses is that Capillary Video-microscopy can uniquely reveal key aspects of the release mechanisms of water-soluble drugs from double-emulsion globules and their transport into neighboring giant liposomes that mimic biological cells. The goal is to elucidate the phenomena which govern these mechanisms and the control of which will ultimately decide the successful application of soluble emulsions as drug-delivery systems.<br/><br/>Ephedrine hydrochloride (EPH HCI) will be used as the model water-soluble drug, encapsulated in the W1 compartment of a W1/0/W2 globule, and the oil membrane will be paraffin oil. Oil-soluble, nonionic surfactant Span-80 (sorbitan monooleate) and water-soluble, non-ionic surfactant Tween-80 will be studied as factors of both globule stability and drug release. The osmotic pressure gradients in the double-emulsion globules will be adjusted through NaCl.<br/><br/>Microcapillaries (~200 um i.d., 10 200 um) will be fabricated from melting point tubes (1.1-1.2 mm i.d. x 100 mm) by pulling them in the middle using a Narishige PB-7 micropipette puller (see Picture 2). Injection and micromanipulation pipettes with fine tip will be shaped by pulling microtubes (Microcapes. 0.688 mm i.d. X 78 mm) from one of their ends so as to produce a tip of outside diameter 10-15 um. Micropipettes will be future fashioned with a microgorge (Narishige MF-9, see picture 3), thus allowing us to polish the end of the pipette or to bend it to a desired shape.<br/><br/>To prepare a W1/0/W2 globule, a microcapillary will be filled with pure water or a saline solution at first. A micropipette filled with oil (containing oil-soluble surfactants) will then be inserted and will inject a large oil drop. Subsequently, and internal ephedrine-hydrochloride-solution droplet will be formed into the oil via the same procedure as the one that produces the oil drop. This globule preparation procedure will lead to an osmotic pressure gradient between W1 and W2 phases, which will cause the release of the water-soluble drug. A single globule will be used in each experiment and the complete transport process in this globule will be observed microscopically. In those experiments that will monitor the transfer of EPH HCI to a vessel, a giant vesicle will first be prepared with 1-palmitoyl-2oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine through electroformation.<br/><br/>By using different salinities in W1 and W2 and EOPH HCI concentrations in W1 we will know under their conditions the water-soluble is delivered by a ""swelling-breakdown"" mechanism. The time needed before rupture will be used as a measure of the drug release rate. An obvious geometrical factor that will effect the time of rupture is the size of the W1 droplets. Since smaller W1 droplets will take longer to burst, polydisperity in such droplets should lead to prolonged release, and thus will be studied as a tool to control delivery.<br/><br/>Under those salinity conditions that will not produce swelling and breakdown, water will transport from W1 and W2 via some diffusion-facilitating mechanisms, such as reverse micellization, spontaneous emulsification, hydrated-surfactant or lamellar-facilitated transport. We will determine the kinetics of such drug release as effected by various surfactant combinations and formulations that will favor certain mechanisms over others under different conditions.<br/><br/>To visualize the transport of the released material from the W1/0/W2 globule to the neighboring giant vesicle, aqueous fluorescent dye (N-Methylhdroxy-quinolinium iodide) will be added to ephedrine hydrochloride solution. In order to simulate possible release situations in the body, both contact and non-contact a configuration of a double-emulsion globule and a giant vesicle will be studied. To study drug transfer under globule-vesicle contact, the giant vesicle will be pushed gently so as to visually touch the W1/0/W2 globule."

For example, a designer can highlight a new system feature (e.g., your travel history displayed on a map) and show which friends are using this new addition. By making it seem as if sharing is the norm -- after all, your friends are doing it -- the designer signals to the end-user that he can and should participate and share information. This research focuses on two broad themes: what are the effects of design choices on changing what users think is appropriate to share and with whom? and how do norms interact with design to impact these decisions? Understanding how disclosure decisions are made and manipulated is critical as corporate and individual interests can be quite different. This is because norm-shaping can be used for benevolent purposes, such as guiding the end-user through an unfamiliar interface, but can also be used to manipulate the end-user and cause him or her to share information he or she would have preferred to keep private. The fact that such design patterns can be used both ways makes them particularly interesting: the user has no way of inferring the designer's intent, and policy makers and well intentioned designers have no mechanism for assessing the norm-shaping properties of their design choices. This research contributes to the development of tools to study user interfaces as embodiments of social norms as well as contributing more broadly to the discourse of privacy and sharing online.<br/><br/>The specific research goals are to (a) identify design patterns that shape disclosure norms, (b) experimentally determine the mechanisms by which they work (e.g., how patterns modify perception of norms and thus behavior), and (c) integrate these observations into existing theoretical frameworks (e.g., the ""privacy calculus"") that model how disclosure decisions are made.  The PIs plan to use experiments to identify the impact of design on the perception of social norms and subsequent information divulging behavior. The experiments combine methodologies from experimental economics with Human Computer Interaction (HCI) methods. Additionally, the PIs will test econometrically an extension of the privacy calculus model that includes a preference for norm compliance, estimating an individual's willingness to trade-off between privacy preserving behavior and compliance with sharing norms. This research will  demonstrate how tools from different disciplines can be used to enhance understanding of design in privacy and HCI. The results would feed back to the privacy, economics, and HCI communities."

By becoming deeply involved in research projects and participating as members of cutting-edge research labs, students will: 1) develop research skills through authentic research experiences and targeted training; 2) strengthen preparation for completing the baccalaureate degree in computer science or a related discipline; 3) increase preparation for applying to and entering doctoral programs; and 4) create and disseminate novel innovations through collaborative research and publications with graduate student and faculty mentors. <br/><br/>Human-computer interaction (HCI) is a growing field that is concerned with how to design and create computational artifacts that serve the needs of their users. Multimodal HCI involves enabling users to interact through multiple modalities, such as speech, gesture, and touch, modalities that tremendously increase the contexts and users that our software systems can serve. This REU site focuses on intelligent multimodal HCI, which brings together the power of adapting to individual users with the flexibility of multimodal interfaces. This project, which targets students who are historically underrepresented in computing, will help build a generation of computer science students whose research and development work directly benefits many facets of society."

In this project, the PI will develop a rigorous computational architecture, the Task-Integrated-Modeling (TIM) architecture, and an associated methodology for evaluating user interfaces in complex multitasking environments.  The TIM architecture centers on integrating cognitive models of behavior with the interface in the context of the multitasking environment, using ""cognitive architectures"" to represent and simulate user cognition and behavior.  Based on these models, the architecture allows a designer to rapidly evaluate new interfaces through stages of rapid prototyping, task demonstration, integrated model creation, and computational simulation.  The theory behind the architecture and the system itself will account not only for various aspects of human multitasking but also of individual differences, facilitating robust modeling of a range of user populations.  As a test domain for the architecture, the project will focus on the domain of driving, particularly the use of device interfaces in the vehicle and the study of different driver populations (e.g., younger vs. older drivers).  The PI will implement a rapid development and evaluation system for new in-vehicle interfaces that attempts to minimize potential driver distraction from these interfaces.   In addition, shared Internet libraries of software applications, toolkits, and cognitive models will be created, for dissemination to and use by academic researchers as well as industry designers and developers.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  Through collaborations with academic researchers and industry experts, the PI will rigorously address the problem of driver distraction (currently the leading cause of crashes in the United States), helping to explore the sources of distraction and helping to devise rigorous methods of improving the safety of our vehicles and roadways.  The computational infrastructure developed will not only advance our theoretical understanding of human cognition, but also realize these theories in real-world practical systems.  The project will involve diverse populations, directly by including under-represented groups in research work and summer workshops, and indirectly by exploring how individual differences may affect interface use and multi-tasking.  Locally, the related education plan will result in new courses in human-computer interaction, cognitive systems, and off-the-desktop computing at Drexel University, providing a unified HCI curriculum for roughly 40-50 students per year in the HCI track and even more across the Computer Science Department and the University as a whole.  The PI will also initiate an annual educational and hands-on HCI workshop for high-school students in West Philadelphia, focusing on the under-represented minority populations in these neighborhoods, in the hope of exciting and inspiring these students to pursue further education and careers in fields related to people and technology."

The target users are young ""presymbolic communicators"", which includes children who have no functional speech and no use of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices, but who have idiosyncratic gestures, movements, and vocalizations that family members can understand. The population includes, for example, individuals with severe cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, and Rett syndrome. The project provides such individuals with their first usable and adopted piece of assistive technology; and provides assistive technology practitioners, family members, and caregivers with an easily-replicated protocol and toolkit for developing and deploying AAC solutions on their own. The project engages graduate and undergraduate students in research and practice that solves specific real-world problems, and builds scientific theory that is badly needed in the field of assistive technology.<br/><br/>The project establishes a new interdisciplinary approach to the design and deployment of assistive technology and AAC solutions. The approach integrates human-computer interaction (HCI) and communication disorder sciences (CDS), specifically the HCI-based approach of user-centered design with CDS-based approach of establishing and evaluating communication protocols. For example, consistent with CDS approaches, parents and children are engaged in a clinical setting to collect screening and evaluation data; and consistent with HCI approaches, families are engaged in participatory design sessions in their homes to fully explore ideas for new AAC devices. Through this multi-faceted user engagement, the project is developing fundamentally new (a) user-centered design processes to collaborate with parents and children to arrive at the precise child-device interaction that will work for a child with profound intellectual impairments, and (b) software and hardware toolkits to rapidly explore a wide range of customized user interactions to engage these presymbolic communicators."

How does the QWERTY keyboard perform in communities whose language has no ""Q"", ""W"", ""E"", ""R"", ""T"", nor ""Y""?  What is the point of a personal computer in a context where technologies are not held for a person but are shared by a whole community?  Computer applications and PC appliances have traditionally been designed by and for Western high-income populations.  But today the Internet and internet-enabled computers have become a truly global phenomenon, reaching out to many of the most remote and marginalized communities.  This workshop will be held on Saturday and Sunday, April 4-5, as an official part of the ACM 2009 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2009) in Boston.  The workshop will explore interaction design in the context of international development, and in particular will address interaction design for parts of the world that are often marginalized by current systems and applications designers.  The PI believes that to extend the boundaries of existing practice in designing information and communication technologies, design should be with, for, and of the marginalized communities he plans to set centre stage in the workshop discussions.  The workshop will provide a forum to exchange experiences, to explore differences between developed and developing world contexts, to develop new partnerships, and to learn from each other's experiences.  NSF funding will enable approximately ten international delegates to attend from low-income countries, from which participation would otherwise be impossible; without the active involvement of these participants, the outcomes of the workshop would be far less useful and effective.<br/><br/>The annual CHI conference, sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (ACM SIGCHI), is a leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of human-computer interaction (HCI) research and practice.

Research papers presented at the conference are heavily-refereed and widely cited; they constitute some of the most scientifically respected research publications in the field of HCI.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  A review of the HCI literature exposes the broad intellectual gap that exists between problems of computer interaction and studies of the development impact of computer technologies in low-income countries.  The PI expects that this workshop, building on the outcomes of two previous meetings at CHI 2007 (funded in part by NSF) and CHI 2008 (which led to establishment of a website http://hci4d.org that provides a platform for exchange of information, ideas, and experiences in this domain), will be instrumental in developing additional intellectual momentum around these topic areas.  Position papers generated as part of the workshop and summary articles will be published in a special issue of the journal Information Technology and International Development, as well as in ACM Interactions, Interfaces magazine, and Usability News.  The PI is also working on a story-based template, which will provide an online repository for reporting findings and observations that can be easily searched and shared."

Wearables for disaster response are promising because responders' hands are often busy and their awareness must be on their surroundings rather than a screen, making it hard to use common computing devices like smartphones, tablets, or computers.  A number of prototype wearable technologies exist that might help: head-up displays can show data alongside the physical world; audio headsets can enable communication with both teammates and computers; armbands can provide touch-based feedback and allow gestures for communication and control; sensors can detect location, motion, and aspects of people's physical and mental state.  However, usable wearable systems and design guidance for building them is scarce in general and even scarcer in the context of disaster response.  The key insight behind the proposed work is that interfaces for training simulations and computer games make heavy use of head-up displays and specialized controllers; further, these often share elements of real disaster response scenarios.  This project will study the features and effectiveness of these interfaces to generate design guidelines for wearable computing systems.  Working closely with the Texas Task Force One response team, the project team will create custom-built wearable systems to support their mission as well as purpose-built mixed reality training simulations that combine virtual simulation with physical-world settings.  The team will validate those simulations with the disaster response partners and use them to test and improve both the wearable technologies and the design guidelines the team creates.  Both the work itself and the lessons learned will be used to improve classes at the lead investigator's institution around designing mixed reality technologies and human-computer interaction (HCI); the lead, and his institution, are also committed to broadening participation in computing education and computing research.<br/><br/>The work will start with a deep study of training practices and needs for disaster response teams.  The team will closely collaborate with its existing task force partners, using ethnographic observation of their existing training practices and interviews with task force leaders to develop models of task force training requirements and design considerations for wearable systems to support them.  These will be disseminated both to disaster response teams and the HCI community.  In parallel, the team will extract design best practices from existing training simulations and computer games, focusing on those that align with disaster response scenarios and needs.  Team members will analyze the interaction techniques and mechanics these systems use -- how they provide situation awareness through ancillary displays, interface controls for managing large numbers of units and functions, and communication facilities for multiple participants -- along with people's preferences for and ability to use them.   This will lead to a design catalog of existing interfaces and best practices for designing wearable and mixed reality interfaces that, along with the requirements identified through studying the task force, will inform the design of both wearable interfaces and testbed training simulations for disaster response contexts.  These design activities will involve regular communication with task force partners to get feedback on using the interfaces in real situations, helping to align both the technology and simulation designs with real disaster response needs.  Finally, the team will evaluate both the interfaces and the developed testbeds through a number of small-scale deployments and experiments, looking at how they support situation awareness, efficiency, and communication, as well as their effect on stress and workload.  Much of the work will be used to support both courses and outreach activities; these include developing cases and projects based on the work for an HCI class as well as leveraging the designed technologies to improve a course on mixed reality.  These will also be used to support a mixed reality interface development outreach activity with the local community college to expose students from underrepresented groups to both research and to work with advanced computing technology."

For the remaining time, students conduct interdisciplinary research projects in groups. The research projects are presented at an end-of-the summer campus-wide research symposium in the form of posters, demos, and a five-page research paper. Intellectual Merit: Two major trends are driving research in Emerging Interface Technologies: a dramatic increase in interface technologies themselves, and the ubiquitous permeation of technology into everyday lives. Correspondingly, research questions focus on four broad areas of EIT: information visualization, mobile/ubiquitous interfaces, intelligent agents, and enabling infrastructure. Faculty in ISU's HCI graduate program compete to participate in the SPIRE and cite strong benefits from participation afterwards.  Broader Impact: Both the HCI program and SPIRE-EIT recruit with an emphasis on underrepresented groups, preparing students for graduate education in the interdisciplinary area of HCI, an area of importance to the US economy. By including instruction on ethics and on research-based evaluation techniques, the SPIRE gives students skills that are useful lifelong, independent of discipline, and which students might not otherwise encounter in a traditional engineering or computer science curriculum. Each year, the SPIRE projects typically result in one-two professional academic conference presentations with SPIRE students as co-authors, disseminating its research results."

The conferences bring together people from diverse areas including graphical and web user interfaces, tangible and ubiquitous computing, virtual and augmented reality, multimedia, new input and output devices, and CSCW. Researchers and developers, from both academia and industry, meet to exchange ideas and present reports on new hardware and/or software advances related to these areas.  UIST 2019 will be held in New Orleans, Louisiana on October 20 -23.  More information about this year's conference is available online at http://uist.acm.org/uist2019/.  The Student Innovation Contest is intended to serve as a catalyst to increase participation of students and junior researchers from diverse backgrounds, due to its accessibility and strong visibility at the conference. This funding will supplement the existing program of the Student Innovation Contest, which is a collaboration between industry (supplying hardware and software) and academia (supplying the general framing and mentoring). The organizers want to increase the attractiveness of the conference for students and researchers from currently underrepresented socio-economic groups. To this end, these funds will be used to support travel and conference expenses of U.S.-based students from groups that would otherwise lack sufficient means to attend.  The organizers will aim to include teams from diverse cultural and institutional backgrounds, with equal representation of genders.  To further increase participant socio-economic diversity, the requested funds will allow the financial support of only one team per educational institution.<br/><br/>The Student Innovation Contest will help shape future research projects aimed at technological<br/>advancement in HCI. The event will promote scholarship and networking among new researchers in this interdisciplinary area. The contest will give students and new researchers constructive feedback on their work, and will expose these promising young researchers to a larger international community. A key component of building this community is through its youth. The Student Innovation Contest brings students together from various backgrounds (e.g., engineering, computing, design, architecture) so that they can see the broader spectrum of research and development approaches.  For the contest, students will receive specific hardware to develop innovative systems and showcase their work at UIST 2019 as demonstrations.  The contest's objectives are to allow promising students and young researchers to showcase their work and technical skills at an internationally renowned conference through an evening-long event and gather feedback from experts in the field, to get access to a large network of researchers and practitioners in the field of HCI and build and expand their own network, to enable these junior researchers to attend the entirety of the UIST 2019 conference, and to support a new generation of researchers with information and advice on academic, research, industrial, and nontraditional career paths.  The Student Innovation Contest will provide an opportunity for student participants to demonstrate their technical and creative skills to a large number of internationally renowned HCI experts, and to create a network of peers that includes both researchers and practitioners. The event will also offer participating teams the opportunity to attend the full conference and allow them to explore the diversity of the research that composes the UIST community. Evaluation of the Student Innovation Contest, and its organization, will be conducted, and the results of the evaluation will be made available to the organizers of future conferences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Technological advances in computing are traditionally understood as coming from industrialized nations, or those that invest heavily in technology research and development.  For the U.S. to remain a global innovation leader, it must significantly enhance the capacity and ability of individuals and organizations to innovate. Based on an integration of human-centered design and postcolonial theory, this research will lead to improved models of innovation and advance our understanding of where and how transformative ideas emerge. Through ethnographic investigation this work will also fill a gap in knowledge regarding how constraints that exist in the U.S., but are more visible in sub-Saharan Africa, can motivate innovations in computing. Centers of information and communication technology (ICT) innovation are shifting in the world.  Emerging economies, such as Kenya, are no longer simply the recipients of innovative design from industrialized nations, but may develop ingenious strategies to navigate economic and technical constraints when using ICT. These workarounds are less obvious to those living in technology-rich environments, but they have motivated innovative computing applications used worldwide, such as mobile banking.  Recognizing Kenya's rural residents and slum dwellers as ICT innovators rather than passive adopters of Western technologies has broader theoretical implications, including completely reimagining approaches to design in HCI. <br/> <br/>The research plan includes a series of theory-driven, ethnographic, and design-based studies that will result in three outcomes: (1) Discovery of empirical evidence that provides a fundamental understanding of how economic and infrastructural constraints visible among sub-Saharan Africa's rural residents and urban slum dwellers affect computing use and can influence innovative design for the rest of the world. (2) Improving upon two models of innovation using the empirical evidence as an intervention in a series of design-based studies to assess and compare the effectiveness of these models to yield design recommendations in these areas: sustainable HCI, collapse informatics in situations such as power outages, Internet data management, and crowd work and entrepreneurship. (3) Advancing the design workbook method by developing and evaluating a portfolio of conceptual designs that explore new practical possibilities raised by results from the ethnographic and design-based studies. Researchers based in the U.S. and Kenya will assess the potential to translate these ideas into marketable realities.  An integrated education plan will provide students with international research experience and opportunities to develop new technologies that target global problems."

The first area of research is the application of HCI techniques and knowledge to the design of formal specification languages---both their printed and automated representations.  The concept of semantic distance for formal specification languages will be made operational and its implications in the design of such languages will be explored.  The approach will involve working with application experts in building real specifications and using this experience to determine what features of specifications they find most natural, and exploring cognitive psychology models of human error and how they can be applied to specification languages to minimize the errors that are made.    The second research topic involves modeling the HCI and performing a hazard analysis on the model.  This work will involve modeling human behavior, developing analysis techniques to identify potential hazardous behavior of both the human operators and the computer, integrating these models into the general model for specification and analysis of critical system properties, and determining how the resulting information can be used in the design of the software and the design of user procedures.  The subject of how current knowledge about the safe design of traditional controls can be applied to the design of computer-based models will be examined and experimental testbeds will be developed to test the hypotheses.  ***"

To design interfaces that more adequately engage this full range of human experience, some researchers now advocate affective computing, in which computers automatically sense, process, and respond to human emotions, but having computers measure and report on intimate data without users' explicit awareness and consent raises substantial concerns around who is in control.  Furthermore, it is challenging to accurately sense complex and elusive emotions influenced by many physiological, individual, and cultural factors that are unavailable to computational sensors, and the need to simplify emotions in order to computationally model them may lead to interfaces that flatten our emotional experiences rather than engaging our emotions in their full everyday richness.  Such problems are based on a fundamental affective gap, a disjunction between the subjective, situated, cultural, and social ways in which people think about and experience emotions and the objective, formalized ways in which computers model them.  In this project the PIs will attempt to close the affective gap by sharing the burden of affective interpretation between people and machines.  In this model, people and machines collaborate to construct affective experiences; machines track user behavior and supply feedback, which users interpret to develop affective awareness.  Shifting the center of interpretation and reflection from the system towards the user keeps users in charge of emotional meaning-making, addresses emotions that computational systems alone cannot truly understand, and focuses our design efforts not on formalizations of affect but on rich, complex, idiosyncratic, and potentially enigmatic emotional experiences.  Systems requiring active user interpretation pose serious challenges for design and evaluation in HCI, since we no longer have direct control of system meaning but instead design and evaluate for unexpected appropriation.  Drawing from the arts, humanities, and critical design, the PIs' systems will encourage interpretation by reflecting the complex, ambiguous nature of affect, allowing people to actively make sense of the system's output in the context of their everyday lives and relationships.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The PIs will develop systematic design and evaluation strategies, a theoretical foundation, and detailed case studies that make affective presence a sustainable, reproducible contribution to HCI.  The work will lead to new technology that leaves users in charge of the interpretation of their emotions yet allows construction of systems that touch on intimate issues without being intrusive, supports user reflection on the role of affect in technology, and enables designers to create a new, wide range of emotional experiences even though computers have difficulty modeling those experiences."

The event will take place in conjunction with the ACM 2003 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2003), to be held April 5-10 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human Computer Interaction (SIGCHI).  Goals of the workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the research field give them advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference.  Student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop, and will receive feedback from the faculty panel.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  Student participants will present their work to the doctoral consortium on April 6-7, with follow up activities to be held during the technical program of the CHI 2003 conference.  Extended abstracts of the students' work will be published in the CHI 2003 Extended Abstracts, which has wide print and electronic distribution.  SIGCHI's conference management committee will evaluate the doctoral consortium, and the results made available to the organizers of future consortia.  The CHI doctoral consortia, which began in 1986, have been highly successful in providing a forum for the initial socialization into the field of young doctoral scholars, and many of today's leading HCI researchers participated as students in earlier consortia. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The annual CHI doctoral consortia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of HCI researchers, allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development.

The PI and Co-PIs explore alternative approaches to HCI including immersive interfaces, virtual reality and ubiquitous computing as well as alternative input modes, such as voice, gesture, and eye tracking. They have also experimented with using objects in the environment as input devices (tangible interfaces) and giving those objects intelligence about where they are in relation to others (smart objects). This proposal describes a way to address the need to expand the pool of HCI practitioners through curricular changes integrating the PI's and others' research. This project involves the development of a sequence of courses for both computer science and math/science education students that teach them how to 1) utilize  new interface technologies, 2) apply those skills in multidisciplinary teams, and 3) evaluate their resulting projects in public settings. The computer science and math/science education students collaborate to develop educational tools designed to get K-12 students interested in math and science. The new courses are taught at two public universities, Brooklyn College (CUNY) and Stony Brook University (SUNY), where they reach students and future/current teachers from both the suburbs and the inner city. In addition, the PI plan two teacher workshops at Stony Brook's Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching, and the installation of the projects in two museums: the New York Hall of Science, and the Goudreau Museum of Mathematics in Art and Science. This combined research curriculum development effort is expected to yield several benefits. (1) The work may impact a broad range of people, including a large number of students in groups that are underrepresented in math and science in college classrooms, public museums, and public schools, (2) This multidisciplinary program will facilitate and support collaboration between computer science students and math/science education students (who are generally practicing teachers). These undergraduate students will learn about state-of-the-art research advances in the area of computer-human interfaces, and how those interfaces can be used to enhance education, apply these technologies to educational applications in a collaborative effort, and participate in research evaluating their applications in real-world settings, (3) Student projects, installed at the Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching, the New York Hall of Science, and the Goudreau Museum of Mathematics in Art and Science, will provide learning opportunities and inspiration to a wider audience including both students and educators, (4) Two workshops, held at the Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching, will help to further disseminate the findings of this project among the community of educators (5) A new textbook, with supplementary materials available online, will enable others to teach these courses at their institutions.

While these toolkits have enabled many successes of the past forty years of research and practice in human-computer interaction (HCI), they have unfortunately also become stifling.  The rigidity and fragmentation of current GUI toolkits makes it difficult or impossible to deploy new ideas in complex existing applications, so researchers are instead often limited to demonstrating and evaluating small toy applications.  This is a major challenge for the field, as it limits both the progress and impact of HCI research.  The PI's goal is to transcend the fragmentation of modern GUIs by building upon their single largest commonality, namely that all GUIs ultimately consist of pixels painted to a display.  He argues that if it were possible to quickly and robustly interpret those pixels, without application source code and independent of its underlying toolkit implementation, we could use that understanding to modify any interface.  The PI's prior work on the Prefab system has shown promising preliminary results, enabled by a strategy of reverse engineering widget appearance.  In the current project the PI will develop methods for pixel-based interpretation of graphical user interfaces, including methods for identifying complex widgets, for extracting widget content, and for recovering widget relationships, and he will build upon these to model widgets state and to address occlusion of portions of interfaces.  He will create methods for modifying graphical user interfaces, including semantic views on pixel-based interpretation, methods for manipulating underlying interfaces, methods for translation between presentations, visual programming methods, and end-user tools for interface customization.  He will implement new tools for informing, deploying, and evaluating interaction research in the field, and he will partner with leading researchers to apply these tools to target-aware pointing and automatic interface generation.  And he will validate his pixel-based methods in real-world datasets collected from broad deployments.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  In this project the PI will pursue a vision of a transformative democratization of every aspect of interaction, in which instead of being limited to a single provided interface anybody can modify any interface of any application.  For example, an HCI researcher might implement and evaluate a new interaction technique in several existing applications; a practitioner or hobbyist who sees the publication might add the technique to their favorite applications.  Web communities might organize around causes, such as translating interfaces into new languages, improving the accessibility of existing applications, or updating interfaces to support gestures, speech access, or other interactions.  End-users might browse libraries of extensions, vote on their favorites, and use visual programming tools to create their own.  Project outcomes, including tools and dataset, will be openly disseminated.  The PI will make special efforts to recruit students from under-represented groups, to integrate the research into existing and new courses, and to use a high school design competition as a channel for recruiting high school students for internships."

Users who are completely paralyzed (""locked-in"") or those who lack muscle control (e.g., people with cerebral palsy or stroke victims) can use BCIs to answer simple questions, to control their environment, and for word processing.  But the variety of brain imaging techniques that have been tried to date for BCIs have all suffered from serious drawbacks, so that communicating through such systems is currently time consuming and mentally demanding.  Open research challenges concern the accuracy of BCIs (systems often misinterpret a user's intentions), and the information transfer rate of such systems (which is often too slow for use in real world settings).  In this project, the PIs will build on their experience in designing, implementing, and evaluating non-command, adaptive user interfaces (e.g., based on eye movement), to advance BCI by bringing to bear emerging technology for measuring brain activity using functional near infrared (fNIR) spectroscopy coupled with machine learning to analyze user data in human-computer interaction.  While fNIR technology is still in its infancy, the PIs expect its use as a real-time input to an adaptive interface to break new ground.  The PIs believes that this combination will also lead to new, more objective methods for evaluating next generation interaction styles for HCI in general.  The PIs' approach is a natural extension of and will exploit their prior work relating to the concept of reality-based interaction, which focuses on the ways that new interaction styles exploit the user's pre-existing skills and expectations from the real world more than trained computer skills, while at the same time helping to differentiate mental effort devoted to interface-related or syntactic aspects from that devoted to the underlying task or semantic aspects.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  This project will develop technologies of immediate benefit to users with motor disabilities.  Additionally, the work will open up a new area of HCI research (namely, relating to interfaces that can dynamically adapt in real time to the user's cognitive load), and will advance the theory and evaluation of interaction styles in general."

The move of computing from the office desktop to ubiquitous presence in homes, in communities, and at play poses a challenge to human-computer interaction, because many of the attributes that are most important for workplace computing such as efficiency, problem-solving functionality, and standardization, are less central for other parts of our lives.  Designing everyday computing applications that are appropriate for everyday life requires rethinking and adapting our methodologies; otherwise, we risk making all of our life like work.  In this project, the PI will exploit cultural theory to analyze the cultural context of everyday life and develop appropriate computer science technologies and methodologies that support open-ended activity, user reflection, variations in style of living, personal meaning, and everyday values.  These themes will be studied within the context of three applications: a system that monitors a home's emotional climate and provides users with open-ended feedback about it; information appliances for the home that support awareness of consumption; and an affective wearable device that explores emotional issues in backpacking.  The project integrates activities across the disciplines that make up Cornell's new Information Science program, and supports the consolidation of the currently fragmented interdisciplinary community of researchers working in this area.  It will also educate students from a variety of backgrounds and interests to integrate technical and cultural perspectives through interdisciplinary courses and involvement in the PI's research."

Core partners include four school districts (Chandler, Mesa, Tempe, and Tolleson) and the Center for Research on Education in Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology (CRESMET) at Arizona State University (ASU).  The Maricopa Community College District and Intel are collaborators with ASU in delivering the project's research-based services and products to these districts.  The demographics of the partner school districts mirror those of Arizona, where 45% of students are persons of color and the Hispanic population is expanding rapidly. <br/><br/>Pathways will produce tools and knowledge to guide secondary mathematics and science teachers in promoting conceptual learning and STEM behaviors that the literature deems essential for continued STEM learning and course-taking.  These key behaviors include competence and flexibility in scientific inquiry, mathematical problem solving, and engineering design.  A central concept is that of function, which research identifies as a unifying concept of secondary mathematics and science.  As the core strategy of the Pathways model, teams of engineers, mathematicians and scientists will partner with master teachers and STEM education faculty to generate instructional sequences for both teachers and students.  The instructional materials will take the form of modules for secondary mathematics and science teachers, with companion modules for secondary STEM classrooms and companion tools for secondary STEM learning communities.  The professional learning community tools will support teachers in adapting their new knowledge and instructional approaches to their own classrooms by engaging them in deep reflections on their instruction and their students' learning.  Pathways materials will be easily adaptable in any learning environment.  In this project, however, they will be packaged for use in four courses in an ASU graduate degree program for inservice teachers, delivered on-site in the teachers' schools.  To better assist Arizona's many bilingual students, Pathways will adapt student modules to an innovative, research-developed English language learner technology platform.  Other Pathways strategies include activities (such as science fairs for students and a regional conference for high school guidance counselors) to encourage all students to take challenging mathematics and science courses and to consider science-based careers. <br/><br/>Teams of STEM education faculty and graduate students will research the effectiveness of the courses and learning communities on teachers' understanding of mathematics and science concepts and their understanding of the process by which foundational STEM concepts and behaviors develop in students.  They will also investigate the process by which teachers shift their classroom practices to promote improved STEM learning in their students.  Graduate research assistants will be recruited to participate in the Pathways project, preparing many future faculty for careers as STEM education researchers.  Pathways will establish new patterns of information-sharing and collaboration among STEM scientists and educators, community college faculty, secondary administrators and teachers, and industry partners.  The project aims to narrow the majority/minority achievement gap, encourage students to take challenging STEM courses, increase high school student STEM learning and achievement, and improve the pass rates in ASU's introductory calculus, physics and biology courses.<br/>"

NSF funding will be used solely to cover travel, housing, and subsistence for eligible U.S. attendees.  The event will take place on Monday, March 3, 2014, immediately preceding the Ninth International Conference on Human Robot Interaction (HRI 2014), to be held March 4-6 in Bielefeld, Germany, and which is jointly sponsored by ACM and IEEE.  HRI is a single-track, highly selective annual international conference that seeks to showcase the very best inter- and multi-disciplinary research in human-robot interaction with roots in social psychology, cognitive science, HCI, human factors, artificial intelligence, robotics, organizational behavior, anthropology and many more, and invites broad participation.  The theme of HRI 2014 is ""(E)Merging Perspectives"" which seeks to combine both user and system perspectives to advance new and possibly unorthodox methodologies.  To extend the current singular approaches, this year's conference emphasizes papers that demonstrate the usage of novel empirical methods, the integration of empirical findings into complex robot systems, and holistic approaches in system evaluation.  More information about the conference is available online at http://humanrobotinteraction.org/2014. <br/><br/>The Pioneers Workshop is designed to complement the conference, by providing a forum for students and recent graduates in the field of HRI to share their current research with their peers and a panel of senior researchers in a setting that is less formal and more interactive than the main conference.  During the workshop, participants will talk about the important upcoming research themes in the field, encouraging the formation of collaborative relationships across disciplines and geographic boundaries.  To these ends, the workshop format will include oral presentations from 2 student attendees, poster presentations from all attendees, a hands-on meet-and-greet session, two alumni speakers, a keynote, and a panel presentation by senior researchers.  The oral presentations and the interactive poster sessions will provide a forum for participants to share their research, enabling them to receive feedback on their work and to gain perspective on the field.  The hands-on meet-and-greet session will involve networking and the cultivation of cross-disciplinary ideas.  The alumni presentations will provide advice for short-term goals and a recent perspective on looking for jobs within the community.  The keynote lecture will provide a global and future vision for HRI.  The panel presentation will feature five senior HRI researchers from both academia and industry who will share insights about their own careers, answer career path questions, and provide insight into the interdisciplinary nature of the HRI community.  The conversations between the panel and participants will continue over lunch and during dinner.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  This workshop will afford a unique opportunity for the best of the next generation of researchers in human-robot interaction to be exposed to and discuss current and relevant topics as they are being studied in several different research communities (including but not limited to computer science and engineering, psychology, robotics, human factors and ergonomics, and HCI).  This is important for the field, because it has been recognized that transformative advances in research in this fledgling area can only come through the melding of cross-disciplinary knowledge and multinational perspectives.  Participants will be encouraged to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development, to form collaborative relationships, and to generate new research questions to be addressed during the coming years.  Participants will also gain leadership and service experience, as the workshop is largely student organized and student led.

In many applications, incorporating domain knowledge into clustering can help enhance both the quality and the utility of the results of clustering. Unfortunately, users who are not data mining experts currently lack effective means of providing such input to guide clustering. Against this background, Dr. Xiaoli Fern of Oregon State University seeks to develop a novel class of algorithms that take advantage of active learning strategies to interactively elicit information from users to drive clustering. <br/><br/>An important aim of this work is the identification of types of input e.g., in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, that are both informative and easy to interactively elicit from users to improve the quality and utility of the results of clustering. The study is driven by and evaluated using exploratory data analysis tasks that arise in several application domains (1) ecosystem informatics e.g. exploratory analysis of in-field bird recordings; (2) human-computer interaction (HCI) e.g., analysis of HCI data to understand user behavior; and (3) plant genomics in collaboration with scientists with expertise in each of these domains. <br/><br/>Improved tools for interactive exploratory data analysis benefit a broad range of applications including most areas of science in which such analysis is beginning to play an increasingly important role in extracting knowledge from data. For example, in ecological informatics, such tools can help scientists to better understand the impact of environmental changes on bird species which in turn can help develop better methods for managing ecosystems. Research-based education and training opportunities offered by this project help prepare a new generation of researchers and practitioners in exploratory data analysis as well as the emerging area of Ecosystem Informatics at Oregon State University.

Advances in sensing technology and data collection are moving us toward a data-driven workplace. Employers can now gather detailed, granular information about workers from digital communication and wearable sensors, leading to benefits such as improved workplace safety and performance improvements. Yet, these same technologies also have potential for negative impacts on workers: to be invasive, hinder worker self-management, and exacerbate poor working environments.  Research into designing workplace analytics to work better for workers faces two key challenges: (1) given complex organizational dynamics, it is hard to immediately predict the long-term outcomes of design decisions on workers; and (2) researchers lack access to information about and data from proprietary systems currently being deployed in the workplace. This project addresses these challenges by collecting and analyzing available archival data from the development of earlier forms of work measurement that form the precedent for systems used today. This data will be used to understand the long-term impact of data advocacy, and to develop heuristics and methods that will provide guidance for contemporary technology practitioners in design of and advocacy for the data-driven workplace. This research will also inform curriculum design for courses on HCI methods and designing technology for social impact, and a summer school for underrepresented scholars on the same topic.<br/><br/>This research answers three questions: (1) How has workplace data been used to advocate for US workers in the past, in an industry facing analogous challenges to data-driven workplaces today? What was effective and ineffective? (2) How do the decisions and challenges of using data to represent worker perspectives map onto analogous methodological challenges that impact the design of workplace measurement analytics today? (3) How can these design techniques and insights from the past be used in present-day workplace analytics and advocacy for workers in data-driven workplaces?  This project answers these questions by combining historical and design research, organized around a case study of management-engineering projects conducted by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU). Archival data will be gathered and analyzed to identify strategies to use data to advocate for workers and to evaluate the long-term impact of those strategies on work in an industry threatened by a volatile economic climate, outsourcing, and automation.  Through an analysis of historical data-driven design methods for the workplace and an interview study with contemporary union organizers on the use of data systems in contemporary organized labor, the project will identify how and in what ways past union strategies, opportunities, and challenges are relevant to contemporary issues in HCI research in data-driven workplaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All too often, the human-robot interaction (HRI) design is an afterthought, if any thought is given to it at all.  Lessons learned from decades of research in human-computer interaction (HCI) are rarely applied to robotic systems.  In this project, the PIs will attempt to bridge this gap by studying existing human-robot interfaces and developing novel interfaces using HCI techniques modified for robot applications.  To these ends, the PIs will first evaluate the current state of HRI for urban search and rescue, by studying the AAAI Rescue Competition and through formal testing with domain experts.  Particular emphasis will be placed in this study on: discovering best practices for providing situation awareness in HRI where the operator is physically separated from the robot; discovering the best methods for HRI when switching autonomy levels in a robot system, either when the switch is robot-driven or human-driven; and investigating how HRI is affected when a robot can change its shape.  The PIs will abstract from their study guidelines for designing effective HRI; these in turn will inform the PIs' design of a system for urban search and rescue, where the design of the robot's behaviors occurs simultaneously with the design of the robot's interface.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  Evaluation methods for human-robot interaction in general, and improved HRI for urban search and rescue applications in particular, will directly benefit society as a whole.  Insights acquired in this project into data presentation and fusion will inform the design of future human-machine systems that involve decision-making in safety-critical situations. Similarly, better understanding of the types of awareness required of the human in a human-robot system will impact the multi-user computing domain in general.  Since robots often carry more than one on-board sensor (such as video and sonar), information visualization techniques developed during this project that combine disparate sensor information will be applicable to systems such as air defense systems or mass transit control rooms."

Next, he will develop several proof-of-concept VE applications using the domain-specific interaction techniques and implemented in the software framework.  Finally, the PI will educate students, both in HCI (through a new course and textbook on 3D interaction), and in the design disciplines (through the use in courses of the VE applications developed in this project).  This research will have a significant impact in the VE and 3D interaction communities, leading to an increased understanding of how interaction techniques can be tailored to particular tasks and domains.  The software framework will impact research in immersive design, allowing graphics and VE novices (domain experts) to build powerful interactive VE applications.  The example applications the PI builds will impact the design and construction industries, providing a tighter design cycle and an increased understanding of difficult 3D problems.  And there will also be a two-pronged impact in the classroom, where the PI will use VE technology as a learning tool in the design disciplines and introduce cutting-edge research in 3D interaction to graduate-level HCI students.<br/><br/>"

In the past, data quantity and complexity have grown much more rapidly than display capability, placing severe constraints on visualization design and forcing information visualization research to focus on a paradigm of highly aggregated overviews with details of only a small number of data items.  An impending 100x increase in display capability has the potential to enable the simultaneous multi-scale visualization of vast and detailed information spaces.  But current uses of high-resolution displays for visualization are rudimentary, with researchers focusing primarily on the computational aspects of graphics rendering.  To take full advantage of the new possibilities, fundamentally different approaches to information visualization will have to be developed.  In this project the PI will explore, through rigorous scientific experimentation and comparative analysis, the HCI aspects of interactive information visualization on ultra-high-resolution displays, with a view to both truly enabling the high-resolution revolution, and to determining if there should indeed be a revolution at all.  Previously awarded NSF research infrastructure funding has enabled the PI to construct one of the highest resolution display facilities in the world.  Taking advantage of that platform, the PI will collaborate with life scientists who work in an information-rich area of the bioinformatics domain in which there is a desperate need for improved exploration of massive data, along two major thrusts.  Basic research will identify and quantify the fundamental capabilities, benefits, and value of high-resolution visualization, by exploring the task and parameter space of high-resolution displays to identify optimal configurations and evaluate human abilities for perceiving large quantities of high-resolution, multi-scale information.  Applied research will design and evaluate new high-resolution interactive information visualization techniques, to identify the most effective approaches for exploiting the increased display space.  An important project outcome will be baseline scientific data describing the effect of various display issues such as resolution, display size, bezels, and information display techniques on perception, cognition, user performance, and user behavior.  Another outcome will be fundamental new techniques for high-resolution information visualizations that are demonstrably more scalable than traditional low-resolution counterparts.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  This project will spur development of a new research area at the intersection of HCI, massive data visualization, and high-resolution display technology.  Through development of advanced bioinformatics tools, it will directly impact cutting-edge research in the life sciences.  In the longer term, it will guide future industry development of ultra-high-resolution form factors and advanced visualization tools for massive data, which will result in fundamental new data analysis capabilities across a broad range of application domains such as the sciences, command and control, infrastructure management, and the intelligence community."

S. universities and working towards either their Master's degree or a Doctorate) to attend the 2014 International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI 2014), to be held February 24-27 in Haifa, Israel, as participants in a special Student Consortium (workshop), as presenters in the main conference, and as attendees at the conference for general training purposes.  Sponsored by ACM, the annual IUI conferences represent the growing interest in next-generation intelligent and interactive user interfaces; they are the premier forum where researchers from academia and industry, who work at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), come together to exchange complementary insights and to present and discuss outstanding research and applications whose goal is to make the computerized world a more amenable place.  Unlike traditional AI the focus is not so much on making the computer smart all by itself, but rather on making the interaction between computers and people smarter.  Unlike traditional HCI, there is a focus on solutions that involve large amounts of knowledge and emerging technologies such as natural language understanding, brain computer interfaces, and gesture recognition. To this end, IUI encourages contributions not only from computer science but also from related fields such as psychology, cognitive science, computer graphics, the arts, etc.  IUI 2014 will be the 17th conference in the series; topics of interest this year include: intelligent interactive interfaces, systems, and devices; ubiquitous interfaces; smart environments and tools; human-centered interfaces; mobile interfaces; multimodal interfaces; pen-based interfaces; spoken and natural language interfaces; conversational interfaces; affective and social interfaces;  tangible interfaces; collaborative multi-user interfaces; adaptive interfaces; sensor-based interfaces; user modeling and interaction with novel interfaces and devices; interfaces for personalization and recommender systems; interfaces for plan-based systems; interfaces that incorporate knowledge- or agent-based approaches; help interfaces for complex tasks; example- and demonstration-based interfaces; interfaces for intelligent generation and presentation of information; intelligent authoring systems; synthesis of multimodal virtual characters and social robots; interfaces for games and entertainment; for learning-based interactions and for health informatics; empirical studies and evaluations of IUI interfaces; and new approaches to designing intelligent user interfaces.  More information about the conference is available online at http://iuiconf.org/. <br/><br/>The IUI 2014 Student Consortium will build on the success of the previous two such events.  The heart of the Consortium will be a full-day workshop on February 24, immediately preceding the conference, and will be structured to give student trainees exposure to their new research community by giving a 20-30 presentation on their work and receiving feedback from peers and a panel of senior researchers.  Group lunch and dinner will encourage social interaction among the student cohort and informal personal interaction with the mentors.  The students' work will also be featured during the main conference in a poster session, where they will gain additional experience explaining their work to others in the field.  The IUI conference organizers will pay for audio-visual services, two coffee breaks, and space for accommodating attendees in the student session; no funds are requested for these items from NSF.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  This funding will enable attendance at the IUI conference by students who might otherwise be unable to do so for financial reasons.  It will enhance the educational experience of funded participants, by bringing them into contact with leading researchers in the field and by exposing them to the lively discussion during the course of the conference that often leads to opportunities for career advancement.  The quality of the conference itself will be enhanced as well, thanks to a broadening of the base of institutions represented and increased diversity of participants.  The rich exchange of ideas at IUI has previously proven to be a valuable source of ideas for future research, as well as leading to collaborative efforts; this funding will extend the opportunities for collaboration and provide intellectual stimulus to programs that have previously sent few or no representatives to this conference.

In human-computer interaction and ergonomics, Fitts' law is one of the theoretical foundations for interface and input device development and research.  It has served as a theoretical framework for evaluating input devices, a tool for computational interface design, and a logical basis for modeling more complex HCI tasks.  However, ample empirical evidence has shown that Fitts' law and other existing action laws encounter problems, or even fail, when modeling touch interaction, primarily because they do not account for the imprecision of finger touch in interaction. This research will establish robust new action laws for touch interaction, including both pointing and trajectory-based gesturing (steering), which will guide the design and evaluation of touch interfaces and serve as cornerstones for modeling complex tasks, computational interface design and optimization. Given the ubiquitous adoption of mobile devices where touch input is dominant, project outcomes are expected to have broad impact that will reach millions of users.  To demonstrate the practical value and effectiveness of the new touch action laws, they will be used to quantify the touch capacity of older adults, thereby laying the foundation for designing touch interfaces well-suited for that user community.<br/><br/>The starting point for this research will be the principal investigator's Finger-Fitts (FFitts) law derived from the Dual Gaussian Distribution Model and Fitts' law.  This preliminary work will be expanded to model 2D target selection and gesturing tasks.  The research will be carried out following standard practices in Human Computer Interaction (HCI), first deriving candidate models from existing models, hypotheses, and rational assumptions, and then conducting rigorous user studies to evaluate the new models. The experimental results will in turn be used to refine the new models, which again will be evaluated via studies. Project outcomes will include the following theoretical and empirical intellectual contributions: action laws for touch pointing, including both the task form of the FFitts law which will predict touch pointing time with nominal task parameters (i.e., finger travel distance A and target width W), and the bivariate FFitts law which will model 2D pointing tasks on rectangular targets such as buttons, check boxes and hyperlinks; action laws for trajectory gestures (Finger-Steering laws), including a basic form for steering along straight paths and a generic form for other paths; and a touch action law based understanding of older adults' touch interaction capacity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is clearly a difference between an in-person visit and a telecommunication experience. This project will attempt to understand this difference and to reduce it, using and experimenting with robotic technologies called Personal Robot Presences (PRoPs): human proxies in real spaces occupied by other people. Such a robotic telepresence need not have an anthropomorphic form, but it may need a reasonable set of capabilities for interaction. Consequently, this project will seek to better understand the social and psychological aspects of extended human-human interaction. PRoPs are an excellent platform for studying computer- and robot-mediated human interaction because they operate in physical and social spaces, and can interact with a group of people. This social context sharply underlines the difference between this work and many studies of human-machine interactions.  the results of this work are expected to improve our understanding of physical and social interactions that are mediated by computer and robotic devices in real social and physical space, not simply virtual spaces. http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jfc/"

Although access to digital technologies offers great potential benefits, it also puts people at risk of digital security and privacy attacks, and novice technology users in non-Western contexts may lack the technological knowledge and experience required to understand the risks and protect their personal data. Moreover, a growing amount of evidence suggests that (1) these populations face a range of new and interesting digital privacy challenges that result from their different social, cultural, and religious contexts, and (2) the current design of mobile devices, and the privacy mechanisms that come with them, are primarily driven by Western values and do not adequately address the needs of these diverse populations.  This research will help US corporations to be more competitive in the global technology market and enable developers to create privacy-preserving systems that respect different cultures and values.<br/><br/>The research agenda has four primary aims. The first will collect empirical data through qualitative fieldwork that provides a deep understanding of people's usage patterns, privacy concerns, and priorities. The second will analyze this empirical data to generate privacy threat models and assess the relevance, severity, and likelihood of different privacy attacks. The third will use participatory design, software development, and field deployments to create and evaluate novel technical interventions that improve digital privacy by supporting alternative device usage models and increasing people's understanding and awareness of privacy threats. Finally, the fourth will integrate these research efforts into a broad set of education and outreach activities that amplify the project's impact on academia, industry, and society.  This human-centered research advances existing knowledge of digital privacy and technology use in non-Western societies, which will benefit researchers in computer science, security and privacy, human-computer interaction (HCI), global development, and others. The specific intellectual contributions include: (1) developing a fundamental understanding of the privacy challenges faced by novice users in non-Western contexts, (2) identifying new threat models and analyzing the privacy attack landscape, (3) designing and evaluating novel technical interventions that improve digital privacy for diverse populations, and (4) contributing empirical data and design ideas that initiate a new field of innovation at the intersection of HCI for development and computer security and privacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project aims to advance the state of the art in speech processing, wireless communications, data mining, and human-computer interface (HCI) design so that effective child-friendly conversational interfaces can be designed and developed. These technologies will be researched in the framework of early learning and integrated with a progressive understanding of the components of academic performance to develop a literacy assessment system and explore the use of analogous assessment in math. The impact of the proposed approach will be studied with native speakers of American English (AE) and non-native AE speakers of Mexican-Spanish background in a longitudinal fashion starting from pre-K, and in partnership with the Los Angeles and Long Beach Unified School Districts, and UCLA's University Elementary School. These schools have a highly diverse economic and ethnic student body with more than half of the population being Hispanic. The project will analyze children's speech as they grow; develop speech recognition (ASR) algorithms for automating assessments that measure essential emerging literacy and some math skills; create a query-based, longitudinal database for each student; derive instructional guidance from the analysis of an ongoing professional development program for teachers of native and non-native speakers; and develop a nomadic interface among different computers and a central database. No feedback or tutoring will occur. Instead, teachers will use the results to make more timely and appropriate decisions about curriculum and instructional interventions. <br/><br/>Technical Impact: The project will address several fundamental research issues: (a) acoustic modeling: documenting and accounting for inter- and intra-speaker variability cross-sectionally and longitudinally; (b) pronunciation modeling and speaker adaptation techniques that are scalable to children who are 4-8 years old and who are native and non-native English speakers; (c) child-specific language modeling: syntax, non-lexical events, and discourse phenomena; limited-domain natural-language processing  (comprehension); (d) novel noise-robust and distributed ASR algorithms; (e) HCI: age-appropriate ways of displaying information and eliciting responses; (f) data mining: mining sequential patterns to discover trends over time, and user-specified associations; and (g) pedagogic issues: investigate early emerging literacy measures for native and non-native speakers, and discover reliable predictors of short- and long-term literacy success.<br/><br/>Innovative aspects of the proposed approach include: a focus on literacy assessment that considers not only word recognition, but also phonetic and phonological awareness, comprehension and fluency; an exploratory study of automating math assessment tasks; a longitudinal and cross-sectional acoustic  modeling study of very young native and non-native English speakers; extensive  and longitudinal validation of the system, children's performance, and teachers' practices; correlating literacy measures to later reading performance; and pioneering research efforts involving system deployment in wired and wireless environments.<br/><br/>Educational Impact: The project will foster interdisciplinary activities at: the U. of California, Los Angeles (Electrical Engineering [EE], Computer Science, and <br/>Education), U. of Southern California (EE, Linguistics, and Neuroscience), and U. of California, Berkeley (Education), in partnership with local elementary schools. Several renowned experts, including international experts from Mexico and Sweden, from academia and industry will act as advisory board members and consultants. Team members have a track record of working together, and the project will serve as a vehicle to train students, postdocs, and school teachers in novel cross-disciplinary research areas of technological and educational significance. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The proposed project will have a profound impact on relieving much of the burden of testing from teachers (allowing them to focus more on what they do best), automated testing for very young children (allowing a greater leverage point for potential intervention), and inclusion of an increasingly diverse population (enabling unbiased assessment and furthering the goal of universal access).  National educational priorities are emphasizing testing to a greater extent than ever before, but increased testing leads to less time for teaching. The proposed system can reduce the test burden and increase the frequency of high-quality, intuitively consumable information about students so that individuals, programs, and schools can evolve more quickly by understanding which methods are working best for which children. Educational policy is also pushing downward to earlier ages to begin formal literacy instruction. This system will provide a useful aid to learn how to help young children succeed and to monitor their progress. The rapid expansion of student groups, reflecting diverse, non-native speakers of English, presents a challenge for fair assessment.  The system helps ensure unbiased assessment of competence in a timely and useful way. It is expected that the project will have a profound impact on improving assessment and instructional material in the classroom.<br/>"

This project will make a significan contribution in the area of HCI modeling.  The PI will expand a computational model and a simulation technology (implementation) called Queueing Network-Model Human Processor (QN-MHP) he has been developing.  QN-MHP is unique, in that it integrates two complementary approaches to cognitive modeling: the procedure and production systems approach (exemplified by the MHP/GOMS family of models, ACT-R, CAPS, EPIC, and SOAR), and the queueing network approach.  Procedure and production systems models have achieved great success in modeling, and in generating the detailed procedures and actions that a person might take in performing, a wide range of tasks; their shortcoming is that although they employ mathematics to analyze specific aspects of their models, they lack mathematical theories to represent the overall structure of their models.  The queueing network model is able to integrate a large number of influential mathematical models of mental structure as special cases (such as Sternberg's serial stages model, McClelland's cascade model, and Schweikert's critical path network model), and is in general well suited for modeling dynamic and complex tasks and architectural arrangements of processes; as a mathematical theory alone, however, queueing networks cannot be used to generate detailed actions of a person in specific task situations, lacking procedural knowledge a person may employ in accomplishing his/her specific goals.  QN-MHP integrates these two approaches by expanding the three discrete serial stages of the MHP into three continuous-transmission subnetworks of a queueing network, by defining each server with procedure functions, and by using a GOMS-style method for task analysis.  In this project, the PI will use extensive driving simulator data as a testbed to (1) study different methods of modeling concurrent tasks with QN-MHP; (2) apply queueing network theory such as optimal network load balancing and server scheduling in multitask modeling; (3) perform time-series modeling and visualization of the relationship between queueing network indices such as network sojourn time and server congestion with human performance data such as time, error, and mental workload; (4) further develop QN-MHP to cover a broader range of human performance such as providing certain servers with production capabilities for problem solving; and (5) further develop the simulation technology of QN-MHP.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The QN-MHP simulator is implemented in ProModel, a widely used software package that requires minimal learning time and allows an analyst to visualize in real time the QN-MHP internal network processes, in addition to the final statistical outcomes.  These features are valuable not only for interface analysis, but also for promoting teaching and training in cognitive analysis and modeling.  This software and other research results will be made readily available by the PI to practitioners, researchers, and educators.  With the proliferation of life-critical multimodal, multitask HCI interfaces such as in-vehicle and aviation devices, QN-MHP will significantly impact system safety and product usability."

The project centers around the development of learning environments; techniques for handling multi-sensory cues in user interfaces, and the use of visual technology in learning and adaptation in intelligent agents. While studying interfaces amenable for human computer interaction and learning, proposed is the acquisition of a CAVE-based immersive environment as well as a motion capture system that will be integrated with it. Exploring techniques such as virtual reality, full motion tracking, and sensor input devices, the work involves working on gesture tracking and recognition/ interpretation, determining how to relate gestures to manipulation of objects.

For the latter project, a motion tracking system monitors the robots and the CAVE to give feedback to the robots. In the area of human computer interfaces (HCI), strategies will be developed for tracking and representing what is going on in the learning environment, including algorithms for rectifying and resolving conflicts among disparate sources (such as multiple pairs of cameras and sensors). Experimentation with various paradigms determines how students may best interact with the objects and information. Ways of interacting with the space and the data in natural, expressive ways, affecting multiple parameters will be explored. In the area of artificial intelligence, the focus will be in determining what the users understand or intend. The investigation of adaptive agents will continue, allowing the system to fill in missing data and learn over time. All tracks focus on how the HCI can enhance collaborative educational environments. <br/><br/>Broader Impact:  Supporting research at a minority institution, the work involves undergraduate and graduate students, including those from underrepresented groups. Exposing a wider audience into science, the work on TICLE exhibits high potential for broader impact in education. Moreover, outreach to K-12 is already under way.<br/>"

Sponsored by ACM, the annual IUI conferences are the premier forum where researchers from academia and industry, who work at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), come together to exchange complementary insights and to present and discuss outstanding research and applications whose goal is to make the computerized world a more amenable place.  Unlike traditional AI the focus is not so much on making the computer smart all by itself, but rather on making the interaction between computers and people smarter.  Unlike traditional HCI, there is a focus on solutions that involve large amounts of knowledge and emerging technologies such as natural language understanding, brain computer interfaces, and gesture recognition.  To this end, IUI encourages contributions not only from computer science but also from related fields such as psychology, cognitive science, computer graphics, the arts, etc.  IUI 2009 will be the 12th conference in the series; topics of interest this year include user input, generation of system output, ubiquitous computing, help, categories of intelligence, IUI design, and user studies.  NSF funds will be used to support two groups of participants: students who are the primary author of a submission that has been accepted as a full paper or poster but whose institution is either unable to provide any funding for conference attendance or able to provide only partial funding that is insufficient to cover the student?s expenses; and other students who would benefit from the conference but who would be unable to attend due to restrictions by their department on funding conference travel for non-authors.  The IUI 2009 organizing committee has undertaken to proactively recruit student participants from schools that have not traditionally been well represented in the IUI community, and also that the bulk of students supported (70-80%) will be from U.S. institutions.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  This funding will enable attendance at this conference by students who might otherwise be unable to do so for financial reasons.  It will enhance the educational experience of funded participants, by bringing them into contact with leading researchers in the field and by exposing them to the lively discussion during the course of the conference that often leads to opportunities for career advancement.  The quality of the conference itself will be enhanced as well, thanks to a broadening of the base of institutions represented and increased diversity of participants.  The rich exchange of ideas at IUI has previously proven to be a valuable source of ideas for future research, as well as leading to collaborative efforts; this funding will extend the opportunities for collaboration and provide intellectual stimulus to programs that have previously sent few or no representatives to this conference."

HRI is a single-track, highly selective annual international conference that seeks to showcase the very best inter- and multi-disciplinary research in human-robot interaction with roots in social psychology, cognitive science, HCI, human factors, artificial intelligence, robotics, organizational behavior, anthropology and many more, and invites broad participation.  The theme of HRI 2013 is ""Holistic Human-Robot Development.""  Robotic solutions are increasingly applied to real world problems such as our aging society, renewable energy, climate control, emergency response, education and exploration. These societal problems require a holistic approach to the design and development of robots that meet human needs, address technical challenges, and foster acceptance in everyday settings.  More information about the conference is available online at http://humanrobotinteraction.org/2013.<br/><br/>The Young Pioneers Workshop is designed to complement the conference, by providing a forum for students and recent graduates in the field of HRI to share their current research with their peers and a panel of senior researchers in a setting that is less formal and more interactive than the main conference. During the workshop, participants will talk about the important upcoming research themes in the field, encouraging the formation of collaborative relationships across disciplines and geographic boundaries. To these ends, the workshop format will include oral presentations from 2 student attendees, poster presentations from all student attendees, a hands-on breakout session with group presentations, a keynote, and a panel presentation by senior researchers who will share their expertise and insights on how to address the interdisciplinary challenge of HRI.  The afternoon breakout session will involve small groups of 3-5 attendees with diverse backgrounds, working to design an integrative HRI project, thereby encouraging group participation and the cultivation of cross-disciplinary ideas.  The presentation session afterward will allow each breakout group to present a summary to the entire workshop; the organizers anticipate that the discussions will continue during dinner. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  This workshop will afford a unique opportunity for the best of the next generation of researchers in human-robot interaction to be exposed to and discuss current and relevant topics as they are being studied in several different research communities (including but not limited to computer science and engineering, psychology, robotics, human factors and ergonomics, and HCI).  This is important for the field, because it has been recognized that transformative advances in research in this fledgling area can only come through the melding of cross-disciplinary knowledge and multinational perspectives. Participants will be encouraged to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development, to form collaborative relationships, and to generate new research questions to be addressed during the coming years.  Participants will also gain leadership and service experience, as the workshop is largely student organized and student led.  The PI has expressed his strong commitment to recruiting women and members from other under-represented groups.  To further ensure diversity, the event organizers will consider an applicant's potential to offer a fresh perspective and point of view with respect to HRI, and no more than one applicant will be accepted from any given institution."

Key areas of innovation in this respect are tabletop, tangible, and multi-touch user interfaces.  These interaction styles leverage users' existing knowledge and skills of interaction with the real, non-digital world; thus, they are often referred to as reality-based interfaces.  Such interfaces offer a natural, intuitive, and often collaborative form of interaction that reduces the mental effort required to learn and operate a computational system.  While these advances in HCI have been successfully applied to a broad range of application domains, little research has been devoted to investigating reality-based interaction in the context of scientific discovery.  The PI argues that it is particularly important to study reality-based interaction in this context, where reducing users' mental workloads and supporting collaborative work could potentially lead to exciting scientific advances.  For example, in a preliminary study of the workflow and computational tools employed by synthetic biologists, the PI found that members of this research community often experience difficulties in specifying, comparing, documenting, and sharing information - interactions that have previously been shown as critical for scientific discovery.  She further observed that the limitations of current computational tools pose barriers for collaboration, information flow, and exploration.  This lack of appropriate computational tools coupled with the inherent complexity of biological systems has limited progress to date, despite the enormous potential of synthetic biology to solve problems such as low-cost drug development and alternative energy production.  In this project, the PI will investigate how reality based interfaces may be able to advance innovation in biological design.  To address this question, she will develop and evaluate a suite of reality-based interfaces that support the design and assembly of novel biological systems, and which she expects will promote collaborative, effective, and safe workflow, facilitate exploration of alternative solutions, and reduce the mental workload associated with accessing and relating large amounts of information.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:   Project outcomes will include: design, implementation, and evaluation of a suite of reality-based interfaces for synthetic biologists; a set of design requirements for developing future such systems; a methodology for evaluating the efficacy of computer-supported cooperative work of scientists; novel techniques for fluid interaction with heterogeneous computational devices of different scale; and a set of design considerations and a participatory design process for supporting scientific discovery.  The PI will train three female undergraduate researchers per year, who will be an integral part of her research team and will participate in an international science competition.  The project will impact computing and science courses at the PI's institution (a women's college) and at collaborating institutions.  In addition, this research will serve as a highly visible ""magnet"" project that attracts undergraduate and high-school students' attention to computer science research through outreach activities."

Initial sales to this wealthier, typically elderly, US audience will pay >$50, helping to fund company growth.  Phase I experiments will add new scientific insights in HCI.  Phase I will yield a low-cost accessory that, in large-scale production, will ultimately have a ~$10 price that is similar to the existing market for styli and texting gloves, which are of limited benefit to the motion-disabled, and more cost effective than accessories such as electronic pens.  This low-cost, single-chip accessory can be scaled up in manufacturing efforts to enfranchise hundreds of millions of motion-disabled individuals worldwide. The proposed device will be operating-system and device independent, and will require lower development costs than competing hardware such as electric pens. If the proposed technology were to be commercialized successfully at a reasonable price, millions in the US (and many times that worldwide) marginalized by the touchscreen revolution will be able to fully participate in the innovations these devices bring to society. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has the potential to improve Human Computer Interaction (HCI) for (~34 million US) motion-disabled users who struggle with capacitive touchscreens.  These screens assume users' fingers act as intermittently connected capacitors. The motion-disabled are unable perform such gestures.  Software-only adaptations and the well-established accessories (styli or texting gloves) do not help the motion-disabled. This project combines an inexpensive hardware accessory, a custom chip and an extra-software-layer running on the touchscreen operating system (OS).  Many motion-disabled are low-income individuals who require low-cost, single-chip accessories?yet such chips have too much parasitic capacitance.  This project is designed to 1) demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating touchscreen accessories that reliably encode low-bandwidth information from the motion-disabled into the signals received by a capacitance touchscreen;  2) develop extra-software-layer applications that interface such accessories for motion disabilities in human-subject evaluation;  and 3) design a chip for such accessories that overcomes cost and parasitic-capacitance problems.  Feedback from human-subject and electronic measurements allow simultaneously optimization of three interrelated issues: hardware reliability, accessory form-factor, and the extra-software-layer functionality.  Results will include subjective and objective human-subject evaluations, accessory form factor, low-parasitic-capacitance integrated-circuit design, code, and OS/application interfacing techniques for such accessories."

Schools are one place students might learn these skills, but in the case of electronics, 3D design, and similar Making technologies, many students lack access to technically-oriented teachers and mentors.  To help address this gap, this project will develop technologies, processes, and training to develop programs where STEM university students provide distance mentorship for rural students around technology.  New technologies are needed because of the hands-on nature of Making activities, which makes remote mentoring through screen sharing or videoconferencing difficult.  Thus, the project will develop technology to enable mentors to provide instruction that includes gesture, eye-gaze, and speech interaction through distance telepresence robotics and augmented reality.  New processes and training are needed as well, to help the university mentors be effective teachers; this will be done through a MentorCorps program that provides education on classroom pedagogy and technology learning.  The technologies and training programs will be developed and validated with high school students in three rural school districts, who will participate in a career and technology education (CTE) course.  The course will provide knowledge in 3D design, fabrication, electronics, computer programming, and basic manufacturing; the high school students will use these skills in turn to prepare science learning kits for elementary schools in their districts.  In addition to advancing the science of remote technology education, the project will have a number of broader impacts.  The chosen school districts in the Colonias region at the Texas-Mexico border serve students who are underrepresented in STEM, and the work will improve their STEM education and work preparedness.  The university mentors, meanwhile, will gain service learning opportunities that develop educational, interpersonal, and empathy skills beneficial to future professional lives.<br/><br/>This project studies how embodied communication involving speech and gestures may be mediated through mobile telepresence robots and augmented reality to support hands-on distance mentoring. At the heart of this project is what a situated distance mentoring experience really means. The project is informed by the psycholinguistics of embodied communication where meaning is expressed through gesture, gaze, and speech as an indivisible whole. Four design-implement-test-deploy-evaluate cycles are planned to learn whether and how powerful multimodal language may be mediated over distance through the designs to support explanation and mentoring. In addition to in-lab workshops to test design versions, the project will deploy and evaluate the finalized design of each cycle in CTE classes in three rural high schools. College science and technology students will pilot the augmented telepresence robots to teach these classes that combine hands-on Maker-based skills and knowledge with engineering principles of manufacturing in three rural high schools to produce learning kits for their local elementary school. The scientific contributions of the project are fourfold: 1. It studies the nexus of embodied communication of space, gaze, and gesture with technical explanation, using resources like artifacts for demonstration and illustration, diagrams and drawing to support distance mentoring for hands-on technology learning. 2. It studies how this multimodal communicative compound may be engaged distally through a mobile telepresence robot extended to provide gaze and gaze awareness and gestures in augmented reality that blends the project space of the student and the gestural space of the mentor. 3. It combines the science and technology research with the real-world educational mission of rural technology education, thus bringing context to the research. 4.It contributes across the fields of psycholinguistics, computer science/HCI, and education. To psycholinguistics: the technical implementation enables the exploration of the embodied language behavior on a platform that can be manipulated to provide new insight. To computer science/HCI: the project investigates embodied interaction techniques that enable powerful multimodal communication strategies via remote platforms. To education: the project investigates means to deliver remote mentoring for hands-on learning that typically requires physical co-presence, and advances Maker-based learning to the engineering practices of manufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, as has become apparent from recent national elections, current voting systems do not always adequately provide a way for all people, especially those with certain kinds of disabilities or who are unable to read, to vote independently, privately and securely.   Statistics indicate this is a serious problem, in that up to one fourth of the adults in the United States are functionally illiterate, and almost one in five self-report a disability of some type.  We can only expect the problem to become more acute in the future, because the likelihood of a disability increases with age, and people are living longer.  Considerations such as these have led the PI to design a prototype direct recording electronic (DRE) voting system called Prime III, with the goal of achieving usable security - namely, a system that is secure and that voters trust, yet which is also easy to use.  To this end, development of Prime III had two important research components: human-computer interaction (HCI) and security.  HCI issues have been addressed in the prototype through a combination of spoken language, touch screen, and other multimodal technologies, in order to enhance the ability of people who previously could not do so to vote without assistance.  With respect to security, concerns that have been noted by various experts (such as vulnerability to hackers, malignant workers, faulty code, lack of recount ability, and human error), have been addressed through solutions such as imposter files, multiple encryption techniques, and an open source format.  An informal study conducted by the PI with the Prime III prototype on the campus of Auburn University yielded promising results, with the vast majority of users preferring Prime III over currently available alternatives.   This funding will allow the PI to refine his initial designs for the system, and to conduct larger scale studies among voting populations such as the elderly, the functionally illiterate, and those who are visually impaired.  Studies to be conducted with this funding will begin, specifically, at the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind, and will continue in Uniontown, Alabama, whose Mayor, the honorable Phillip White, has graciously agreed to participate in the PI''s research.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  Prime III will broaden the participation of voters with various disabilities including those with illiteracy issues.  It is anticipated that the system will ultimately serve as a model for future human-computer interfaces where there is a need to blend usability issues with security concerns."

Advances in sensing technology and data collection are moving us toward a data-driven workplace. Employers can now gather detailed, granular information about workers from digital communication and wearable sensors, leading to benefits such as improved workplace safety and performance improvements. Yet, these same technologies also have potential for negative impacts on workers: to be invasive, hinder worker self-management, and exacerbate poor working environments.  Research into designing workplace analytics to work better for workers faces two key challenges: (1) given complex organizational dynamics, it is hard to immediately predict the long-term outcomes of design decisions on workers; and (2) researchers lack access to information about and data from proprietary systems currently being deployed in the workplace. This project addresses these challenges by collecting and analyzing available archival data from the development of earlier forms of work measurement that form the precedent for systems used today. This data will be used to understand the long-term impact of data advocacy, and to develop heuristics and methods that will provide guidance for contemporary technology practitioners in design of and advocacy for the data-driven workplace. This research will also inform curriculum design for courses on HCI methods and designing technology for social impact, and a summer school for underrepresented scholars on the same topic.<br/><br/>This research answers three questions: (1) How has workplace data been used to advocate for US workers in the past, in an industry facing analogous challenges to data-driven workplaces today? What was effective and ineffective? (2) How do the decisions and challenges of using data to represent worker perspectives map onto analogous methodological challenges that impact the design of workplace measurement analytics today? (3) How can these design techniques and insights from the past be used in present-day workplace analytics and advocacy for workers in data-driven workplaces?  This project answers these questions by combining historical and design research, organized around a case study of management-engineering projects conducted by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU). Archival data will be gathered and analyzed to identify strategies to use data to advocate for workers and to evaluate the long-term impact of those strategies on work in an industry threatened by a volatile economic climate, outsourcing, and automation.  Through an analysis of historical data-driven design methods for the workplace and an interview study with contemporary union organizers on the use of data systems in contemporary organized labor, the project will identify how and in what ways past union strategies, opportunities, and challenges are relevant to contemporary issues in HCI research in data-driven workplaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematical sketching, a pen-based interaction paradigm that is providing a new approach to STEM education, is the process of making and exploring dynamic illustrations by associating handwritten mathematics with free-form diagrams. The proposed research will develop new mathematical sketching tools to improve student learning in STEM. High level semantic recognition techniques for understanding mathematical sketches (the combination of handwritten problem description, mathematical expressions, and drawings) will be explored to ensure proper interactive feedback, facilitation of correct cognitive models, and the generation of the most appropriate dynamic visualizations for a given problem. In addition, these techniques will, in part, be used to develop strategies in inferential statics and dynamics, the process of finding appropriate animations when users do not directly specify motion equations in the problem solving process. Given the reliance on recognition-based interaction in mathematical sketching, usability studies will examine how users are affected by recognition feedback and accuracy levels. These studies will provide useful guidelines for ensuring that the mathematical sketching interface is usable by both teacher and student. Two educational studies will also explore how mathematical sketching affects teaching and learning.  This work will advance the state-of-the-art in pen-based UIs through the development of techniques and exploration of user interface design issues for enriching mathematical sketching.  <br/><br/>Broader Impact: This proposal links research in pen-based UIs with STEM education, a critical application area. Thus, the work has the potential to reach thousands of students each year.  The PI has the opportunity to work on this research in conjunction with the University of Central Florida?s EXCEL Program, an NSF STEP-funded project that helps students succeed in math and science during the first two years of college, where the mathematical sketching paradigm is directly applicable. The PI will give demonstrations and lectures through the Florida High Tech Corridor Council techCAMP program to bring mathematical sketching to teachers and students in African American and Hispanic high schools. The proposed research will be integrated into a graduate-level course on pen-based UIs, thus enhancing the education of tomorrow?s pen-based UI designers and researchers. Finally, undergraduate courses will be taught on human computer interaction (HCI) and design of interactive systems that, together with the graduate course, will be an educational foundation for HCI at UCF.  <br/><br/>"

Aiming to lead to advances in human cognition, perception and action, image processing, intelligent systems, and human-computer interaction, the infrastructure enables interdisciplinary research on novel computational models of visual parsing, categorization, cognition, and as well as research for motor planning and execution. Aiming to achieve novel computational models for implementing humanlike intelligent systems, the project supports research in understanding visual processing in humans during task execution. The instrumentation is composed of three modules: A<br/>. High-resolution immersive screen where virtual scenarios can be simulated for sensing human performances,<br/>. Head-mounted eye tracker system for accurately tracking the navigation of the user's visual attention point, and<br/>. Full-body occlusion-free inertial motion-capture equipment for capturing the motions of the user during performances.<br/>Understanding human-like intelligence is key for the development of seamless and fully integrated attentive user interfaces, affective collaborative work, and many human-computer interaction (HCI) applications needed in the future. Connected to a software architecture dedicated to the motion control and graphical simulation of human-like virtual agents already under development, the equipment supports interdisciplinary research activities such as:<br/>. Analyzing the visual parsing of features in images,<br/>. Analyzing the interactions between gaze and gestures for describing features and procedures, and<br/>. Developing new vision-based motor control algorithms for the coordination of locomotion and reaching during grasping tasks.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The infrastructure greatly benefits the newest campus of the UC system. The institution services an underrepresented population where the students are usually first generation college students. The facility provides valuable programming and lab skills that contribute to success in high tech jobs and graduate schools. It also improves instruction and development of courses and enables research for many application domains, including training, delivery of instruction, ergonomics, entertainment, HCI, and education.<br/><br/>"

HCOMP is the premier venue for disseminating the latest research findings on crowdsourcing and human computation.  While artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) represent traditional mainstays of this cross-disciplinary conference, HCOMP believes strongly in inviting, fostering, and promoting broad, interdisciplinary research.  The diverse disciplines the field draws upon, and contributes to, range from human-centered qualitative studies and HCI design, to computer science and artificial intelligence, economics and the social sciences, all the way to digital humanities, policy, and ethics.  More information about the conference is available online at http://www.humancomputation.com/2017/.  The Doctoral Consortium will be a research-focused full day meeting that immediately precedes the conference, on October 23.  It will enhance the scientific workforce in this emerging research area by nurturing a group of promising young investigators interested in human computation and crowdsourcing. The award will also allow these young researchers to attend the HCOMP 2017 conference, thereby allowing them: to interact with other researchers and conference events; to learn of potential career paths within academia and industry; to access an international network of researchers who can support their professional development; and to observe the interdisciplinary nature, diversity and interrelationships of research in human computation.  The Doctoral Consortium Chairs will select up to 6 additional distinguished researchers to serve as faculty mentors; this group also will serve as the review committee for student applications. Students will be accepted based on a paper giving an overview of the student's dissertation research, an explanation of why the student wants to participate in the Doctoral Consortium, a CV, and a letter of support from the student's advisor. The organizers will give preference to students who are most in need of mentoring and joining a peer group.  Moreover, the organizers will promote diversity among the selected students by selecting no more than one or two students from any one school, and by prioritizing the selection of women and underrepresented minorities.   In accordance with CISE policy, NSF funds will only be used to support students from U.S.-based educational institutions.<br/><br/>The full-day Doctoral Consortium will include activities to guide the research of these promising young researchers. The Consortium will allow participants to interact with established researchers and with other students, through presentations, question-answer sessions, panel discussions, and invited presentations. Each participant will give a short presentation on their research and will receive feedback from at least one faculty mentor and from fellow students. The feedback will be geared toward helping the student participants understand and articulate how their research is positioned relative to other work on human computation and crowdsourcing.  The feedback will also address whether the students' topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are being appropriately analyzed and presented.  Activities led by the faculty will include a panel discussion to give students more information about the process and lessons of research and life in academia and industry. To further integrate the Doctoral Consortium participants into the conference itself, students will have a chance to present their work as posters in an interactive poster session and their papers will be posted online on the workshop webpage. These activities will benefit the participants by offering each fresh perspectives and comments on their work from researchers outside their own institution, both from faculty and other students; providing a supportive setting for mutual feedback on participants' current research and guidance on future research directions; and enabling participants to form a cohort of new researchers."

This is funding to support one of a pair of 1.5-day workshops to be held at NSF in September, 2006, in response to this reorganization.  Each workshop will bring together (a different group of) current NSF PIs whose ongoing research spans the broad spectrum of topics now included in HCC, along with selected additional members of the research community with related interests.  The primary goals of the workshop are to educate the research community about the new HCC cluster and the related solicitation, and to help NSF identify emerging trends in the field.  Participants will discuss and prioritize the important subfields of HCC that the scientific community believes will have a major impact in the near-to-medium term.  Because the workshop will take place in September, there will be sufficient lead-time for the event to affect proposals submitted by the research community for the upcoming solicitation deadlines (October-December, 2006).  In addition, workshop feedback to NSF will occur before proposals are reviewed and funding recommendations made.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  This workshop will present a unique opportunity for current PIs and other members of the rapidly growing HCC research community to discuss the state of the art and to engage in strategic planning toward shaping the direction of this new and interdisciplinary research area with major implications for the future of society.  The workshop will broaden awareness among PIs of the rich variety of research topics that comprise HCC.  It will foster networking across the inherently interdisciplinary focus areas of the field, and will also afford young researchers a chance to receive constructive feedback on their current work and future plans through interaction with more senior investigators with related interests.  The workshop organizers will produce a comprehensive workshop report, and the workshop website will become a permanent repository of the workshop discussions, breakout group reports, etc for general access by the research community at large."

The approach consists of combining two complementary fields that have historically had little interaction -- data mining and human-computer interaction -- to develop interactive algorithms and interfaces that help users gain insights from graphs with hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges.  The goal of the project is to develop mixed-initative machine learning, visualization, and interaction techniques in which computers do what they are best at (sifting through huge volumes of data and spotting outliers) while humans do what they are best at (recognizing patterns, testing hypotheses, and inducing schemas). This research addresses two classes of tasks: first, attention routing -- using machine learning to direct an analyst's attention to interesting nodes or subgraphs that do not conform to normal behavior. Second, sensemaking -- helping analysts build in-depth representations and mental models of a specific areas or aspects of a graph. Evaluation of the tools will involve both controlled laboratory studies as well as long-term field deployments.<br/><br/>As large graphs appear in many settings -- national security, intrusion detection, business intelligence (recommendation systems, fraud detection), biology (gene regulation), and academia (scientific literature) -- the potential benefits of new tools for making sense of graphs is far reaching.

This project will fill this critical gap in research and will investigate the learning and reading-assistance needs of upskilling DHH computing workers, design parameters influencing usability of reading-assistance tools, new training data and methods for text simplification tailored to specific reader groups and technical genres, automatic and human-based evaluation methods, and the impact of such tools on heutagogical learning. The methods will include interview and survey research with DHH computing workers, prototyping and testing of design variations, creation of parallel simplification corpora, readability annotation of lexicon and texts by DHH individuals, NLP research on domain adaptation and syntax-based neural machine translation for text simplification, and observation of real-world deployment of a prototype with DHH students and recent graduates from computing-related programs at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The hope is that by bringing together researchers in HCI and Robotics, it will be possible for the PIs to perform well-designed and rigorous studies of HRI unlike any work that has been done in the past.   The PIs will focus on the effectiveness of techniques for making human operators aware of pertinent information regarding the robot and its environment.  By studying the best practices in HRI, they will enable the creation of better interfaces that provide decision support and reduce the workload of the operator.  The PIs will validate their findings by creating new interfaces for safety-critical robot systems.   They will also develop methods for testing and evaluating human-robot interaction, which will result in better metrics, and will further develop best practices and design guidelines for HRI in safety-critical applications, validated through the testing of new and revised interfaces.   It is important to understand how to turn sensor data into information for decision support to reduce the workload of the human operator and the potential for error, even when the robot and its operator are physically separated.<br/> <br/>Broader Impacts:  The results of this work will allow the PIs to develop course modules for the Robotics II (undergraduate/graduate) and Evaluation of Human-Computer Interaction (graduate) courses at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell.  The research will be disseminated through conference and journal articles; collected data will be made available to interested researchers.  All participants in the study will receive copies of the evaluations of their systems, and will have the opportunity to discuss the results with the PIs; it is expected that these systems will improve due to this feedback, and participants will be encouraged to participate in a future study phase to evaluate the revised interfaces.  More generally, improving human-robot interaction will benefit society as a whole; for example, the results will be useful to the creation of better robotic systems for assistive technology and for search and rescue. <br/>"

Current interests in Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) include understanding how people collaborate across multiple tasks with multiple partners, designing systems that interrupt users intelligently, supporting gestures and other types of nonverbal behavior in remote collaborations, and creating tools that can interpret meetings and other social behavior. The work contributes to the observation and analysis of fine details of human behavior, uses data for understanding human collaboration, especially the mechanics of face-to-face interaction in co-located and remote CSCW. A focus of fine details of human behavior, including facial expressions, body positions, gestures, and movements, is common to these projects, motivated by the belief that in depth analysis of behavior is necessary to move CSWC research and development into the future. CSWS is necessary for understanding the mechanics of face-to-face interaction, for identifying those aspects of face-to-face interaction that are most important to provide remote collaboration, and for programming intelligent collaborative systems. The infrastructure for a multimedia laboratory for research on computer-mediated collaborative behavior consists of the following four elements:<br/><br/>-Motion capture system, Mobile eye-tracking,<br/>-Multichannel video and audio recording.<br/><br/>The components, used independently or in combination, contribute to investigate a wide range of topics in human behavior. Examples include: large-scale collaboration in medical setting, interruptibility, tools for remote gestural communication, and multiple task performance. The enabled research should lead to an improved understanding of fundamental dimensions of interpersonal interaction, including the dynamics of group behavior, interruptibility and awareness, and interrelationships among gaze, gesture, speech, and actions. HCI, computer supported cooperative work, communication theory, social psychology, and organizational behavior might benefit from this work.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The general public is expected to benefit by the creation of new tools to enhance collaboration in fields such as medicine and security.

The event will take place on March 7, 2016, immediately preceding the 11th International Conference on Human Robot Interaction (HRI 2016), to be held March 8-10 in Christchurch, New Zealand, and which is jointly sponsored by ACM and IEEE. HRI is a single-track, highly selective annual international conference that seeks to showcase the very best inter- and multi-disciplinary research in human-robot interaction with roots in diverse fields including social psychology, cognitive science, HCI, human factors, artificial intelligence, robotics, organizational behavior, anthropology and many more, and to this end the conference invites broad participation. The theme of HRI 2016 is ""Natural Interaction"" which seeks contributions from a broad set of perspectives, including technical, design, methodological, behavioral, and theoretical, that advance fundamental and applied knowledge and methods in human-robot interaction, with the goal of enabling human-robot interaction through new technical advances, novel robot designs, new guidelines for design, and advanced methods for understanding and evaluating interaction. More information about the conference is available online at http://humanrobotinteraction.org/2016/. This workshop will afford a unique opportunity for the best of the next generation of researchers in human-robot interaction to be exposed to and discuss current and relevant topics as they are being studied in several different research communities (including but not limited to computer science and engineering, psychology, robotics, human factors and ergonomics, and HCI). This is important for the field, because it has been recognized that transformative advances in research in this fledgling area can only come through the melding of cross-disciplinary knowledge and multinational perspectives. Participants will be encouraged to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development, to form collaborative relationships, and to generate new research questions to be addressed during the coming years. Participants will also gain leadership and service experience, as the workshop is largely student organized and student led. The PI has expressed her strong commitment to recruiting women and members from under-represented groups. To further ensure diversity the event organizers will consider an applicant's potential to offer a fresh perspective and point of view with respect to HRI, will recruit students who are just beginning their graduate degree programs in addition to students who are further along in their degrees, and will strive to limit the number of participants accepted from a particular institution to at most two.<br/><br/>The Pioneers Workshop is designed to complement the conference, by providing a forum for students and recent graduates in the field of HRI to share their current research with their peers and a panel of senior researchers in a setting that is less formal and more interactive than the main conference. During the workshop, participants will talk about the important upcoming research themes in the field, encouraging the formation of collaborative relationships across disciplines and geographic boundaries. To these ends, the workshop format will encompass a variety of activities including three keynotes, a distinguished panel session, and breakout sessions. To start the day, all workshop attendees will briefly introduce themselves and their interests. Following the opening keynote, approximately half of the participants will present 3-minute overviews of their work, leading into an interactive poster session. This will enable all participants to share their research and receive feedback from students and senior researchers in an informal setting. The workshop organizers will facilitate the post-presentation discussion and will encourage participants to ask questions of their peers during the interactive break and poster session. After lunch, the remaining workshop participants will give their 3-minute overviews, followed by presentation of their posters during a second interactive poster session. Senior researchers (in addition to those on the panel) will be invited to attend the student presentations and poster sessions in order to provide feedback to participants, and workshop participants will be invited to present their posters during the main poster session of the HRI conference as well. The conversations between the panel and participants will continue over lunch and during dinner."

Many are expected to need physical and cognitive assistance, and all will need additional healthcare. Shortages in primary care physicians, nurses, and managed care facility space and staff are already an issue today, creating a niche for assistive technologies to fill the care gap. A growing body of research shows that certain behavior patterns have a positive impact on longevity and wellness, including regular physical exercise, social interaction, and cognitive engagement. This project aims to develop and evaluate socially assistive human-machine interaction techniques that influence the user to engage in and comply with wellness-promoting behaviors in the home or nursing home in order to enhance longevity and quality of life.<br/>This work is focused on developing socially assistive systems (SAS) using peer-level human-machine interaction in which the machine serves in the role of a knowledgeable embodied agent capable of providing time-extended, sustained, and engaging interaction. The research focuses on two types of wellness-promoting human-machine interactions: 1) exercise sessions (cognitive and/or physical) and 2) socializing sessions.  For one-on-one exercise sessions, the project is developing SAS capabilities that provide exercise monitoring, coaching, and motivation.  For socialization, the research is developing SAS capabilities that provide social interaction and friendly reminders and encouragement to comply with health regimens (taking medicine, being physically active) and healthy habits (calling family, meeting friends).  The two types of interactions share the common goal of influencing human behavior, and the main contribution of the research is the set of methods and algorithms for influencing behavior though human-machine interaction. This is achieved through a novel two-fold approach: 1) adaptive interaction steering for short-term interactions, and 2) motivation and coaching of behavior in longer-term interactions to maintain engagement and enhance task performance. The embodiment of the SAS is leveraged to maximize engagement and compliance; a key focus of the work is on developing a comprehensive method for natural, persuasive and engaging embodied communication. The methods and algorithms being developed are general, and will be implemented and tested on both computer-based and robot-based agents.  In this way the work validates the developed methods on multiple technology platforms and embodiments, and compares their relative effectiveness and acceptability by the intended user population. The specifics of the implementation are informed by an early focus group with elderly participants, the target user population.  The developed techniques are being implemented in both human-computer interaction (HCI) and human-robot interaction (HRI) versions, and are being evaluated with a large group of elderly users interacting with the SAS implementations over a multi-week user study.  The work is focused on generating methods, algorithms, and a large corpus of multi-modal data (video, audio, and questionnaires) for grounding continued research into health and wellness-relevant HRI and HCI.<br/>        This project aims to address a component of the nationally recognized healthcare challenge of promoting wellness and longevity in the aging population.   Beyond basic algorithm and method development, the project implements and tests real-world socially assistive systems, both computer-based and robot-based, with a large population of elderly retirement home residents.  The project is expected to produce insights useful for both research and healthcare product development for addressing this growing segment of the population.  In addition to the socially relevant research focus, the project team is also engaged in a comprehensive program of K-12 outreach activities, which use robotics to promote STEM topic learning using the health theme of the proposal.  The project involves inner city K-12 teachers and students in annual open houses, assemblies, and workshops that provide hands-on experiences with assistive systems for the elderly, as well as take-home materials for continued learning.  The project team includes PhD students, undergraduates, and K-12 volunteers, and establishes a mentoring pipeline so that university students are both mentored and serve as mentors and role models for their younger peers."

In particular, no one has yet developed a robust graphical model and accompanying human-computer interface that can simultaneously (a) represent volumetric shapes of arbitrary topology and anisotropic material distributions, (b) efficiently simulate complex physical and dynamic behaviors in real time; and (c) facilitate natural, convenient interaction between human users and such 3D digital representations.  In an effort to tackle the aforementioned challenges, and thereby bridge the large gap between real-world physical objects and CAD-based digital models, and improve communication and interaction between human beings and computer generated virtual environments, the PI will in this project develop Digital Sculpture, a novel two-hand haptic interface for HCI.  Digital Sculpture will employ a new graphical model and solid subdivision scheme that unify modeling and animation for both geometry and material properties within a single physical framework, and will include a suite of two-hand, haptics-based interactive techniques for managing and manipulating the new representations in virtual environments.  To date, two-hand haptic systems have been severely under-explored; an important outcome of this project will be the comprehensive investigation of a two-hand haptic system.  The PI will validate the effectiveness of the new theoretic, algorithmic, computational, and software techniques that facilitate the interaction of Digital Sculpture in virtual environments via a two-hand haptic interface, via comprehensive usability studies that compare his technique and paradigm with existing ones in order to assess the benefits of the anticipated improvements.  Variants of the new technique will also be explored (e.g., one-hand vs. two-hand Digital Sculpture to assess the gains provided by a haptic input from a second glove, even under conditions when the second glove remains stationary).<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The novel HCI paradigm of a two-hand haptic interface would be invaluable in all applications in which 3D structures must be manipulated, including for example surgical simulation and virtual sculpting.  The comprehensive study of novel, two-hand haptic interaction techniques will further deepen our understanding of haptic-based human-computer interaction."

Nationwide, more than 20,000 Americans suffer from ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease. While augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) tools exist to aid these patients to control computers and other devices, current solutions all have significant shortcomings for users with extremely limited movement or speaking ability. We have developed non-invasive neuromuscular sensing technology which detects small, intentional movements of muscles, and allows micro-movements to be transmitted wirelessly to devices such as computers. While developed for ALS patients, this technology can be repurposed for other markets (e.g. enterprise augmented-reality, consumer electronics, computer gaming) with minimal alterations. The interest of large technology companies in human-computer interaction (HCI) demonstrates demand for nonfatiguing, silent, hands-free input methods. The company plans for sales to the ALS market through channel partners, and for miniaturizing the technology and licensing circuit design and software for other markets, to achieve adoption by hundreds of millions of users. This pathway enables worldwide distribution to ALS users through partner companies.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project results from an innovative approach to improve augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) usability for individuals, using a proprietary hardware/software neuromuscular human-computer interface (HCI) system. The device to-be-developed detects and transmits skin-surface electromyography/electroneurography (EMG/ENG) voltage signals. Phase II research objectives are to: 1) develop a software/firmware Machine Learning (ML) platform to enhance the existing device, to allow robust detection/classification of EMG/ENG signals (neuromuscular activation data) as computer commands, and 2) conduct user testing of a commercial AAC integration of the device, in a task-based (e.g. web-browsing) protocol for ALS patients. Testing in Objective 2 will validate accuracy of the ML models developed as part of Objective 1 (with data collected in human subjects).

From exploring on-line videos to searching vast information spaces with keyword search interfaces, the information scope and societal impact have changed.  HCI researchers therefore need new strategies to study, respond, and adapt to changing circumstances as the context for research changes. Quantitative methods such as social network analysis (SNA) and surveys are appropriate techniques for addressing some research questions in some types of online social spaces, but they have limitations. For some studies, qualitative methods, specifically applied ethnography, may offer the only way to deeply understand users' behavior, intentions and feelings within the social-digital ecology of the Web.  <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to examine the issues that researchers encounter when attempting to understand diverse types of behavior in large online spaces using ethnographic approaches. To accomplish we will conduct a two-stage study. Stage 1 will produce a meta-analysis of current research literature on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia and other large-scale social systems, and on keyword search interfaces, to identify the methods that were used by researchers, under what assumptions, and which outcomes these studies reported. Stage 2 will produce a grounded theory analysis of case studies of how a sample of HCI researchers do qualitative research, particularly ethnography, in these vast and changing information spaces."

S. universities and working towards either their Master's degree or a Doctorate) to attend the 2018 International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI 2018), to be held March 7-11 in Tokyo, Japan, and to participate in a full-day Student Consortium (workshop) that will be held on March 9.  Sponsored by ACM, the annual IUI conferences represent the growing interest in next-generation intelligent interactive user interfaces.  Attracting 200-300 attendees, they are the premier forum where researchers from academia and industry worldwide who work at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) come together to exchange insights and to present outstanding research and applications whose goal is to make the computerized world a more amenable place.  Unlike traditional AI the focus is not so much on making the computer smart all by itself, but rather on making the interaction between computers and people smarter; and unlike traditional HCI, there is a focus on solutions that involve large amounts of knowledge and emerging technologies such as natural language understanding, brain-computer interfaces, and gesture recognition. To this end, IUI encourages contributions not only from computer science but also from related fields such as psychology, behavioral science, cognitive science, computer graphics, design, the arts, etc.  IUI 2018 will be the 23rd conference in the series; more information about the conference is available online at http://iui.acm.org/2018.  This funding will enable attendance at the IUI conference by students who might otherwise be unable to do so for financial reasons.  It will enhance the educational experience of funded participants, by bringing them into contact with leading researchers in the field and by exposing them to the lively discussion during the course of the conference that often leads to opportunities for career advancement.  The quality of the conference itself will be enhanced as well, thanks to a broadening of the base of institutions represented and increased diversity of participants.  The rich exchange of ideas at IUI has previously proven to be a valuable source of ideas for future research, as well as leading to collaborative efforts; this funding will extend the opportunities for collaboration and provide intellectual stimulus to programs that have previously sent few or no representatives to this conference.  The organizing committee has undertaken to proactively recruit student participants from schools that have not traditionally been well represented in the IUI community.  Women and students who are members of underrepresented groups will be particularly encouraged to participate.  To further assure diversity, no more than two students will be accepted from any given institution.<br/><br/>The IUI 2018 Student Consortium will build on the success of previous such events.  The heart of the Consortium will be a full-day workshop on March 9.  Student trainees will be afforded exposure to their new research community by giving a 20-30 presentation on their work and receiving feedback from peers and a panel of senior researchers.  A group lunch and dinner will encourage social interaction among the student cohort and informal personal interaction with the mentors.  The students' work will also be featured during the main conference in a poster session, where they will gain additional experience explaining their work to others in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Following a federal court order to remedy long-standing racial segregation in public housing and in schools, the city of Yonkers, NY built 200 units of low-rise public housing in mostly white, middle-income neighborhoods. Subsequently, a group of very low-income, mostly African-American and Latino families was moved into this housing between 1992 and 1994. This project would comprise a 2-year follow-up study of these families, who will be re-interviewed to examine short-term adaptation to their new neighborhoods. This project will permit a closer examination of the human capital and other social factors thought to mediate the impacts of neighborhood on the social attainment of families. Several factors make this an exceptionally rich longitudinal data set for analyzing neighborhood effects: the project combines the best outcome measures of previous survey studies on housing mobility with social process and social interaction measures highlighted in a long tradition of ethnographic research on neighborhoods; a quasi-experimental design is used to minimize selection bias; a large breadth of measured variables is employed; a high survey completion rate (90%) was attained at baseline; multiple levels of data collection (parents, children and youth) are used; detailed neighborhood ecology data beyond the census data typically used in this form of research is available; and the inclusion of a significant sub-population of Latinos and African-Americans is possible. The project is relevant to a number of the research priorities central to the Human Capital Initiative, especially those related to workforce, neighborhoods and families."

Yet most speaker recognition systems today rely exclusively on the lowest-level features, breaking the speech stream into a series of 10-20 msec frames modeled essentially as independent events.  This project explores higher-level sources of speaker-distinctive information via two feature discovery tracks: one building on existing linguistic constructs and guided by insights from psycholinguistics and human performance studies; the other a purely data-driven approach, seeking idiosyncratic ""vocal performances"" -- spectro-temporal patterns with high speaker-characterizing power, independent of linguistic constraints.  Supplementing this core feature discovery program, project efforts include work in feature selection and combination, work to encode these information sources into more effective speaker models, and evaluation of these models primarily for speaker recognition, but also in other speech technology applications.<br/><br/>On the theoretical side, this work should lead to a better understanding of what makes a speaker's voice and speech behaviors unique, what constitutes normal within-speaker variation, and what dimensions are important for modeling speaking style.  Further, the resulting speaker models should have numerous practical applications: improving speaker recognition systems, providing more speaker-focused models for automatic transcription, facilitating analysis of speaker behavior, and supporting more personalized human-computer interaction.  In addition, this work will make resources available to the broader research community through the dissemination of feature datasets and through educational activities.<br/>"

In addition, the complexity of simultaneous expression of linguistic information on the hands, the face, and the upper body creates special challenges for both linguistic analysis and computer-based recognition.  A major goal of this project is the development of pattern analysis algorithms for discovery of the co-occurrence, overlap, relative timing, frequency, and magnitude of linguistically significant movements of the hands, face, and upper body.  These will be tested against the PI's recently developed corpus collected from native signers of American Sign Language (ASL).<br/><br/>The high-quality video data consist of multiple synchronized movie ?les, showing the signing from multiple angles (including a close-up of the face).  Annotations were produced using SignStream (an application developed by the PIs), which enables transcription of parallel streams of information (e.g., movements of the hands, eyes, eyebrows, etc., that convey critical grammatical information in signed languages).  The video data and annotations provide a basis for analyzing gestures occurring in the multiple manual and non-manual channels.  The goal is to recognize temporal associations both within and across channels. Time-series analysis algorithms will be developed for comparing the degree of similarity of gestural components.<br/><br/>Clustering and indexing algorithms will be developed for identification of groups of similar gestural components from mixed discrete annotation event labels (e.g., gloss, eyebrow raise, hand-shape, etc.) and sampled measurement data (e.g., head orientation, direction of eye gaze, hand motion).  Since several gestural channels include periodic motions of varying frequency and magnitude (e.g., head nods and shakes), periodicity analysis modules will also be developed.  Linguists and computer scientists will collaborate to determine how best to exploit and combine the information available from these different sources.  Moreover, the information emerging from the computer science research will be of enormous benefit for the ongoing linguistic research being conducted by the PI's research team on the syntax of ASL.  Syntactic research on signed languages has been hindered by the daunting task of attempting to uncover these patterns solely through observation, without the aid of tools for analyzing large amounts of data.<br/><br/>To support time-series pattern analysis in SignStream, computer vision algorithms will be developed for analysis of video to extract measurements the head, face, eyes/eyebrows, arms, and upper body, as well as hands.  These algorithms will model and exploit joint statistics; i.e., they will explicitly model correlations and associations across gestural channels.  The vision algorithms will also make use of information available from the existing annotations to acquire models via supervised learning.  These algorithms will allow a feedback loop where the dynamical models estimated during data analysis/clustering can be used to ""tune"" the tracking modules to specific gestures.<br/><br/>It is expected that this approach should prove useful in analyzing gestural patterns in other HCI applications.  As part of the effort, the SignStream system will be employed in user studies of vision-based interfaces for the severely handicapped, in collaboration with colleagues at Boston College.  Video will be captured via multiple cameras, and partially annotated by the HCI researcher and the clinicians, supplemented with performance data (speed, accuracy, fatigue) and output of the vision analysis algorithms.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  Algorithms and software developed in this effort will be made available to the research community via FTP, as extensions to SignStream.  Thus, these tools will be available to the established, diverse group of researchers who already use SignStream in linguistics and computer human interface research.  The gestural pattern analysis tools developed in this project should accelerate linguistic research on the critical role of non-manual channels in signed languages and gestural communication.  Moreover, better understanding of the combined role that non-manual and manual channels play should lead to improved accuracy in computer-based sign language recognition systems, as well as speech recognition systems that model gestural components observed in video.  Conversely, systems for synthesis of signed languages and gestural communication would be able to model and generate these non-manual movements over the appropriate linguistic domains, in order to achieve better realism.  Finally, it is hoped that pattern analysis algorithms will be useful in the study of gestural interfaces more generally. Insights gained via such analysis tools should lead to improved video-based interface systems (e.g., for the severely-handicapped) that allow greater comfort, accuracy, and ease of use."

This system will provide a useful aid to learn how to help young children succeed and to monitor their progress. The rapid expansion of student groups, reflecting diverse, non-native speakers of English, presents a challenge for fair assessment.  The system helps ensure unbiased assessment of competence in a timely and useful way. It is expected that the project will have a profound impact on improving assessment and instructional material in the classroom.<br/>"

This research will produce a design framework that enables mobile learning researchers to create environments that support sophisticated learner interactions. The research seeks to extend the use of Intelligent Tutoring Systems to include mobile learning environments that integrate new mobile applications and media. The resulting models will advance the understanding of human interaction with emerging technologies to benefit everyone interested in modeling human interactions for learning or training purposes.<br/><br/>The project seeks to model the behavior of users engaged with mobile learning environments and explore children's ideas for novel mobile learning environments. The two research questions to be answered are: 1) Can inquiry behaviors and complex thinking in personalized mobile learning environments be modeled? As users interact with technologies, they exhibit usage patterns that can be used to create models of their behaviors and understanding such behaviors is critical for making realistic learning environments. This question seeks to understand how to both model and create meaning from these interaction patterns. 2) How can advanced learning technologies extend and support traditional instruction in ways that personalize instruction for various learners? The use of children as design partners, via participatory design sessions, will change their role from that of end user to designer and result in mobile learning applications that extend beyond those commonly available in the popular mobile application marketplaces."

Chief among these problems is an ignorance of eye movement.  Most state-of-the-art HMDs use head pose to approximate line-of-sight, which may cause a significant disparity between what users are intended to look at and what they actually see.  The integration of eye tracking capability into HMDs would significantly improve display quality and user interface.  In this project, the PIs will optimize the conceptual design of HMD-eye tracker integration from low-level optical configurations; the PIs expect to achieve by this means a more compact, comfortable, easy-to-use, and dependable system than would result from integration of off-the-shelf commercially available displays and eye trackers.  The PIs will set up a comprehensive methodology to calibrate and quantitatively assess the testbed, and to quantify rendered and perceived depth/size representations of virtual objects with and without eye tracking capability in the HMD; the PIs expect thereby to determine whether integration can significantly improve the performance of both eye tracking accuracy and display quality as it relates to accuracy and precision of registration of real and virtual objects in augmented environments.  Finally, two pilot studies will be pursued.  The first of these will explore the concept of a unique fovea-contingent display scheme which utilizes photonics technology to position a high resolution inset at the gaze point, innovatively with no moving parts, in order to address the trade-off between field of view and resolution existing in conventional HMDs.  The second pilot study will investigate a ""pointing by looking"" visual interface in remote collaborative environments in which the focus of attention of a participant follows the point-of-regard of a remote collaborator, or vice versa.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  This research will not only advance display quality and the user interface, but most importantly it will drive new and thrilling applications of augmented reality technology.  In particular, the new HDM-eye tracker technology will lead to novel interactive interfaces for information retrieval, will provide more accurate eye-movement monitoring for human factors and vision research, will support improved assessment of behavior in virtual environments, and will afford new methods of interaction and communication for people with certain types of disabilities.  The mixture of basic optical science and engineering, computer graphics, human factors, and hands-on experience with building a testbed will be an excellent interdisciplinary training ground for the graduate and undergraduate students involved."

In each of the               sequences, the limestone-marl couplets are characterized by                     decimeter-scale alternations of even-bedded, laminated limestone                and marls; well-preserved calcareous fossils in marl layers                     indicates a primary depositional(versus diagenetic origin) to the               interbeds.  Spectral analysis of the limestone-marl interbeds will              be conducted to determine whether there is a regularly cyclicity                to the bedding couplets, and the duration of the cycles will be                 determined from a range of sedimentation rates calculated for each              individual sequence.

The emphasis of the              pilot project is to develop accurate and time-efficient sampling                techniques for generating time series in interbedded limestone and              marl facies.  In previous studies, time series generated from                   variations in HCI-insoluble residues has proven to be an accurate               method, however it is very laboratory-time intensive.

Specific planning grant activities will include describing and             interpreting the sedimentologic and stratigraphic characteristics               of the basinal facies, evaluating the lateral continuity of                     limestone-marl couplets, sampling the best-exposed section for                  variations in HCI-insoluble residues, magnetic properties, and bed-             thickness variations.  Results from spectral analysis of the                    different time series will be compared to determine which time                  series sampling technique(s) are appropriate for interbedded                    limestone-marl facies.                                                               The cause of millennial-scale paleoclimatic fluctuations is                not well understood, however they have been attributed to changes               in solar activity or due to the nonlinear response of the climate               to precessional (~20,000 yr) orbital forcing.  If the periods of                such persistent oscillations can be characterized, they offer the               potential for developing high-resolution chronostratigraphy, with               a greater resolution than Milankovitch cycles, that can be used to              calibrate the length of time between absolute datums, variations                in sedimentation rates, biologic evolution rates, and the time                  intervals over which geomagnetic reversals occur."

Their main application to date has been for the physically disabled population, where they typically serve as the sole input means.  Recent results on the real-time measurement and machine learning classification of functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) brain data lead to this project, in which the PI and his team will develop and evaluate brain measurement technology as input to adaptable user interfaces for the larger population.  In this case, brain input is used as a way to obtain more information about the user and their context in an effortless and direct way from their brain activity, which is then used to adapt the user interface in real time.  To accomplish this a multi-modal dual task interface between humans and robots will be introduced, which will serve as a particularly sensitive testbed for evaluating the efficacy of these new interfaces.<br/><br/>The project will create and study these new user interfaces in domains where the effect on task performance of introducing the brain input to the interface can be measured objectively.  They are most useful in demanding, high-performance, multitasking situations.  Carefully calibrated multitasking applications scenarios from the team's research in Human-Robot Interaction will be employed. <br/><br/>The project will also advance the range of fNIRS brain measurements that can be applied to user interfaces. It will study a recently identified fNIRS signal obtained from the phase relationships among different regions of the scalp at low frequencies (0.1 Hz), as well as a wider range of sensor placement locations than previously examined.  As these are developed into usable measurements for real-time signals with machine learning and other analysis approaches, they will be incorporated into new user interfaces.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The target of the research is adaptive interfaces for non-disabled users, where brain measurement is an additional source of user input.  However, as the work proceeds toward making this into a more robust technology project outcomes will have promise for physically-challenged users, and ultimately they promise to improve the lives of people with severe motor disabilities."

But independent lifestyles come with risks.  To address these issues, researchers are developing ""smart home"" technologies to help older adults remain independent at home while controlling costs.  Smart homes enhance residents' safety and monitor health conditions using sensors and other devices.  Such technology can help keep older adults independent while controlling costs.  The PIs have proposed a model of decline in older adults in which mobility and cognitive impairments lead to functional decline, thereby reducing independence.  Appropriate interventions, if offered in a timely manner, can improve functional ability.  The key is early identification of changing conditions that indicate impairments.  In this project, the PIs will establish a partnership among faculty, students, and researchers across diverse schools within two universities, in order to develop and evaluate intervention technology for elders.  They will utilize a unique eldercare facility in Columbia, called TigerPlace, to study technology targeting mobility and cognitive impairments.  Project objectives include: development of an integrated monitoring system that reliably captures data about the elder residents and their environment in a noninvasive manner and balances the needs of health safety and privacy; collection of data in typical independent living, elder settings, using the integrated monitoring system; development of algorithms to extract patterns of activity from the collected sensor data; and evaluation of the usability of the technology and investigation of fundamental issues in human-computer interaction for the population of older adults.  To these ends, a monitoring system developed by one of the participants and incorporating gait, physiological, and environmental sensors will be extended.  An event-driven video sensor network will be developed to generate an ""anonymized"" video stream that hides identifying features of the residents, and sensor and video data will be fused and processed for identifying patterns of behavioral activity.  Fundamental human-computer interaction (HCI) issues as related to elders will also be investigated.  Deliberative evaluation and usability studies will be conducted.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  This project will have broad impact on our society, by offering a model for eldercare technology and by providing policy makers with answers to complex questions of cost effectiveness and outcomes to help guide decisions about services for older people, such as those funded by Medicare and Medicaid (it is estimated that 12.4% of the U.S. population was over 65 in 2000, and this percentage is projected to grow by 2030 is 20%).  From the technical point of view, the research will advance the state of the art in HCI for elders, in anonymized and compressed video, in extracting human motion and behaviors from video data, in extracting human activity from sensory events, and in fusing sensor and video data for identifying behavioral patterns.  In addition, the project will train both graduate and undergraduate students and help establish an infrastructure in conducting future research projects; faculty and administrators from Lincoln University in Jefferson City, MO will assist the PIs in recruiting traditionally underrepresented nursing and CIS students for multi-disciplinary teams and summer internships."

All too often, the human-robot interaction (HRI) design is an afterthought, if any thought is given to it at all. Lessons learned from decades of research in human-computer interaction (HCI) are rarely applied to robotic systems. In this project, the PIs will attempt to bridge this gap by studying existing human-robot interfaces and developing novel interfaces using HCI techniques modified for robot applications. To these ends, the PIs will first evaluate the current state of HRI for urban search and rescue, by studying the AAAI Rescue Competition and through formal testing with domain experts. Particular emphasis will be placed in this study on: discovering best practices for providing situation awareness in HRI where the operator is physically separated from the robot; discovering the best methods for HRI when switching autonomy levels in a robot system, either when the switch is robot-driven or human-driven; and investigating how HRI is affected when a robot can change its shape. The PIs will abstract from their study guidelines for designing effective HRI; these in turn will inform the PIs' design of a system for urban search and rescue, where the design of the robot's behaviors occurs simultaneously with the design of the robot's interface.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Evaluation methods for human-robot interaction in general, and improved HRI for urban search and rescue applications in particular, will directly benefit society as a whole. Insights acquired in this project into data presentation and fusion will inform the design of future human-machine systems that involve decision-making in safety-critical situations. Similarly, better understanding of the types of awareness required of the human in a human-robot system will impact the multi-user computing domain in general. Since robots often carry more than one on-board sensor (such as video and sonar), information visualization techniques developed during this project that combine disparate sensor information will be applicable to systems such as air defense systems or mass transit control rooms."

Key areas of innovation in this respect are tabletop, tangible, and embodied user interfaces. These interaction styles leverage users' existing knowledge and skills of interaction with the real non-digital world, thus we refer to them as reality-based interfaces (RBI). RBIs offer a natural, intuitive, and often collaborative form of interaction that reduces the mental effort required to learn and operate a computational system. While these advances in HCI have been successfully applied to a broad range of application domains, little research has been devoted to investigating reality-based interaction in the context of scientific discovery. However, it is particularly important to study reality-based interaction in this context where reducing users' mental workload and supporting collaborative work could lead to new scientific discoveries. The goals of this research are to design, develop, and evaluate the benefits of a tabletop reality-based interface for collaborative exploration of heterogeneous genomic information. The investigation will focus on how tabletop reality-based interaction can support collaborative research and facilitate new discoveries. Specifically, the investigator will address two questions: What is the key computational functionality required to enable an effective use of a tabletop reality-based interface for genomic research? And, can reality-based interface improve users? work flow and facilitate the development of new biological insights?<br/><br/>This research program addresses a number of broader impacts. First, successful results of this project will foster collaboration and improve work flow in genomic research, thus, may lead to new scientific discoveries. This investigation will contribute a design, implementation and validation of a tabletop reality-based interface that supports collaborative genomic research, and a set of design requirements for supporting collaborative scientific discovery in areas where vast amounts of heterogeneous information is explored.

Sponsored by ACM, the annual IUI conferences represent the growing interest in next-generation intelligent and interactive user interfaces; they are the premier forum where researchers from academia and industry, who work at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), come together to exchange complementary insights and to present and discuss outstanding research and applications whose goal is to make the computerized world a more amenable place. Unlike traditional AI the focus is not so much on making the computer smart all by itself, but rather on making the interaction between computers and people smarter. Unlike traditional HCI, there is a focus on solutions that involve large amounts of knowledge and emerging technologies such as natural language understanding, brain computer interfaces, and gesture recognition. To this end, IUI encourages contributions not only from computer science but also from related fields such as psychology, cognitive science, computer graphics, the arts, etc. IUI 2012 will be the 15th conference in the series; topics of interest this year include: Intelligent interactive interfaces, systems, and devices; Ubiquitous interfaces; Smart environments and tools; Human-centered interfaces; Mobile interfaces; Multimodal interfaces; Pen-based interfaces; Spoken and natural language interfaces; Conversational interfaces; Affective and social interfaces; Tangible interfaces; Collaborative multi-user interfaces; Adaptive interfaces; Sensor-based interfaces; User modeling and interaction with novel interfaces and devices; Interfaces for personalization and recommender systems; Interfaces for plan-based systems; Interfaces that incorporate knowledge- or agent-based approaches; Help interfaces for complex tasks; Example- and demonstration-based interfaces; Interfaces for intelligent generation and presentation of information; Intelligent authoring systems; Synthesis of multimodal virtual characters and social robots; Interfaces for games and entertainment; for learning-based interactions and for health informatics; Empirical studies and evaluations of IUI interfaces; New approaches to designing Intelligent User Interfaces. More information about the conference is available at http://iuiconf.org/. <br/><br/>This year IUI is organizing a student Doctoral Consortium (workshop) for the first time to expand student attendance and training in this area (see: http://iuiconf.org/doctoral_consortium.html). The Doctoral Consortium will be held as a day-long event on February 14, 2012, immediately preceding the conference, and is designed to give students exposure to their research community, including an opportunity to present their work to and receive constructive feedback from their peers as well as senior scientist mentors in the field. The students' work will also be featured during the main conference in the poster session, where they will gain additional experience explaining their work to others in the field. It is essential that our current generation of students receive good quality training in intelligent interactive interfaces, since such interfaces will be key components of future interactive systems in a variety of domains; therefore, the doctoral consortium is designed to encourage Ph.D. students to start building a professional support network of peers and mentors. The organizing committee has undertaken to proactively recruit student participants from schools that have not traditionally been well represented in the IUI community. Priority will be given to funding students representing different institutions (no more than 2 from any given institution); women, minority students, the disabled, and veterans all will be encouraged to participate.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This funding will enable attendance at this conference by students who might otherwise be unable to do so for financial reasons. It will enhance the educational experience of funded participants, by bringing them into contact with leading researchers in the field and by exposing them to the lively discussion during the course of the conference that often leads to opportunities for career advancement. The quality of the conference itself will be enhanced as well, thanks to a broadening of the base of institutions represented and increased diversity of participants. The rich exchange of ideas at IUI has previously proven to be a valuable source of ideas for future research, as well as leading to collaborative efforts; this funding will extend the opportunities for collaboration and provide intellectual stimulus to programs that have previously sent few or no representatives to this conference."

Myers, Carnegie Mellon University<br/><br/>Understanding software is a prerequisite to taking any action to change it, and this remains expensive and error-prone.  Research with programmers in the field has identified significant barriers to understanding.  Lab and field studies of usability barriers in understanding and using APIs will result in models of how developers understand the design of the objects.  These results will lead to new software tools for API exploration and understanding.  Work on enabling people to better understand and fix bugs through new visualizations and interaction techniques will allow them to ask ""Why"" and ""Why Not"" questions about their code, with the answer visualizing the responsible code and dataflow.  New tools will support understanding code by others during reverse engineering activities, focusing on how data and control can flow through large and complex programs.  Using static analysis techniques and a new ""WhatTree"" visualization will allow programmers to investigate the update paths of their programs, while supporting the programmers in collecting and keeping track of facts and hypotheses about how the program operates.  The results will improve programmer success and thus their overall productivity.<br/>"

University instructors commonly distribute course assignments, syllabi, and other course-related information on the World Wide Web (WWW).  This practice makes the material accessible to sighted students, but it may be an impediment to visually impaired students unless the material is universally accessible.  The basic premise of universal accessibility of instructional materials is that a curriculum should include alternatives to ensure that it is accessible and applicable to students and teachers with different backgrounds, learning styles, abilities, and disabilities in widely varied learning contexts.  In spite of recent initiatives such as the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Accessibility Initiative (W3C WAI) and availability of improved software tools such as screen readers used by blind computer users, many problems remain with respect to universal accessibility. These tools cannot handle many of the complex features of the WWW such as tables, forms, and frame-based Web pages. This project will perform research on developing techniques and tools that will make Web pages more accessible to visually impaired students.  In particular, research efforts will be directed toward developing techniques to make frame-based materials, tables, and forms found on Web-pages accessible.  These techniques will be implemented in a prototype software tool.  The approach is based on parsing and analyzing the HTML structures that constitute a page (containing tables, forms, frames, etc.) to produce tree-based structural representations.  The newly developed tool will navigate the structural representation and produce meaningful output such as audio and speech.  Particular attention will be paid to representing tables since tabular information is the hardest to convey to a blind person.  This is primarily caused by the structural information that is implicit in a table that is lost when it is read aloud linearly as is done by most screen readers.  Input from the Web-page author (such as a course instructor) will be sought so that this structural information can be conveyed.  The structural information (or hints for comprehending the table) to be conveyed is formalized as a hierarchy tree in the planned approach.  A separate graphical tool will be designed that will interactively allow the page author to produce this hierarchy tree.  The hierarchy tree will be employed to appropriately interpret the HTML structures representing tables to provide improved accessibility to visually-impaired users.  A similar approach will be developed for pages containing frames.       The tools to be developed will employ programming language semantics-based techniques, as the task of interpretation requires assigning appropriate meaning to the HTML code.  Modern parsing, language processing, and compilation technology will further aid in the development of these tools.  Many of the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) issues that arise in the context of blind users will be researched as well.  Finally, these tools will be thoroughly evaluated, and the results of these evaluations will be used to make the new tools even more accessible. <br/>"

Consequently, the design of low latency, high bandwidth, power-efficient and reliable Network-on-Chips (NoCs) is proving to be one of the most critical challenges to achieving the performance potential of future chips. While multicores are facilitating an enormous integration capacity, aggressive transistor scaling has also led to a steady degradation of the device and circuit reliability. Increased device wear-out (due to negative-bias temperature instability (NBTI), electro migration (EM) and hot carrier injection (HCI)) has exacerbated the waning reliability of transistors, thereby resulting in a significant increase in faults (both permanent and transient), and hardware failures. As faults manifest within the NoC substrate, multicore chips are faced with excessive delays and increased power consumption while recovering from the fault. While NoC reliability research has made significant strides at inter- and intra-router levels, there is still a lack of a holistic design approach covering the reliability of the entire NoC architecture, from device wear-out, to links and routers, to routing protocols, to applications in a cohesive manner.<br/><br/>This project will develop a holistic design methodology that addresses the reliability of the entire NoC communication infrastructure (device, links, routers, routing algorithms, and topology) while minimizing energy footprint, reducing the area overhead and only marginally impacting performance. To achieve our goal of improving link fault-recovery, this project will develop techniques to maximize the utilization of the inter-router links with minimum power and area overhead. For the router, this project will propose intra-router reliability techniques with the goals of maximizing hardware utilization, reducing redundancy and area overhead, and minimizing router pipeline latency. Further, wear-leveling techniques developed by this project will improve the reliability of NoCs and the lifetime of the chip. Finally, the proposed techniques will be evaluated by developing fault models that are injected into the NoC and evaluate the fault coverage, performance degradation and energy efficiency through extensive modeling and simulation. The holistic design methodology spanning the entire NoC architecture and the reliability techniques developed from this project will positively impact the next generation multi-core and System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures with improvements in energy efficiency, performance and robustness to hard faults and soft errors. This project will play a major role in education by integrating discovery with teaching and training, and by attracting and training minority students in this field."

It measures the impact on student's ability to generate and implement creative design solutions in the context of a human-centered design and manufacturing course for MAKING. This project seeks to understand how the course may impact graduate students whose creative potential may have been altered (perhaps diminished) through traditional formal education. The four distinct graduate programs that will be investigated are: industrial engineering (IE), mechanical engineering (ME), industrial design (Design), and human-computer interaction (HCI). Graduate students from different backgrounds are encouraged to understand how things work; to invent and redesign things through multiple iterations; and to develop and test prototypes quickly in a cost-effective manner.  Within this MAKER learning context, the impacts of industrial experiences and disciplinary knowledge on learners' creative outcomes are being investigated.<br/><br/>This project adds to the collective knowledge of how various disciplines consider and approach creativity and design, and in what ways industrial experiences affect graduate students' creative outcomes. This project will help us to better prepare students with cross-disciplinary and convergent creativity and provide more comprehensive understanding of design through creativity-focused teaching and rapid prototyping (MAKING processes). Part of the long term goal of this project is the development of creativity in highly trained Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workers. Ultimately, the impact of this systematic investigation on creativity in a MAKING environment will provide information that will support increasing the number of STEM based workers in the United States.  This project has the potential to introduce and engage a wide range of learners, including meritorious students, from a rural community to MAKING. The planned sustainability of the proposed program also ensures continuity of potentially engaging all learners, including those of high merit but insufficient means; therefore, S-STEM co-funding is deemed appropriate for this project. This in-context engagement/introduction to making will present a pathway for learners to pursue STEM degrees.

In contrast, very little symbolically-represented music exists, preventing music from fully participating in the 21st century.  The International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP) is a large and rapidly growing open library of public domain machine-printed classical music scores, actively used by many musicians, scholars, and researchers around the world.  Optical music recognition (OMR) forms the natural bridge between the IMSLP and the missing symbolic music data.  While there has been active OMR research since the 1960s, the state of the art still is not sufficiently well-developed to create symbolic data from realistic documents, as represented on the IMSLP.  This is because music notation contains a thicket of special cases, exceptions to general rules, image pathologies, and interpretation challenges, whose recognition requires a deep level of content understanding.  With this in mind, the PI has developed prototype software named Ceres for supporting a hybrid human-computer team, in which both machine and person partner in a collaborative recognition effort.  The human guides the computer through the recognition task, identifying and providing crucial missing pieces of information, while allowing the computer to fill in the details, consistent with the human guidance.  The ultimate goal is to build a Wikipedia-like community centered around Ceres and the IMSLP with the mission of creating a definitive, open access, symbolic music library that distributes music scores electronically and globally, allowing for adaptive display and automatic transformation and registration of scores with audio and video.  The prevalence of symbolic music data would open up a world of possibilities to music-science researchers, including systems for music information retrieval, expressive performance, musical accompaniment, transcription and arranging, performance assistance, and many others.  Last but not least, the symbolic music library would enable innovative commercial applications; tablet computers will likely be the sheet music ""delivery system"" of the future, allowing automatic page turning, performance feedback, and various kinds of content-based annotation. <br/><br/>The challenge of integrating both human and algorithmic intelligence to create a tractable and efficient OMR solution constitutes the heart of this project.  The PI's approach is to adopt the interface paradigm of constrained optimization; the human uses domain understanding to supply crucial missing pieces of information when needed, and the computer uses this guidance to re-recognize and reinterpret subject to these user-supplied constraints.  A preliminary experiment conducted by the PI using a medium-difficulty test set showed a 17% error rate on the part of his prototype system, accounting for both false positives and false negatives at the primitive level.  The human-computer interface is where the recognition results become tangible and subject to manipulation, so its design is critical; this is an area where the PI expects to make contributions to HCI in general.  The PI argues that to be useful for OMR the interface should be almost completely open, providing a set of tools and options, and imposing only the minimal required structure (e.g., staff recognition must be verified before we identify page structure, while the latter must be verified before it is worth continuing to the symbol recognition phase).  The interface development strategy will be one of iterative refinement, the evaluation of each version to involve time- and effort-oriented metrics as well as open-ended user comments.  For example, the Ceres user interface (the null hypothesis for the current project) superimposes the recognized results on the original image, making discrepancies readily apparent (in contrast to other systems that present side-by-side original and recognized notation which is cognitively more difficult to compare), but maybe even better solutions are possible?  Other aspects of the work will include exploration of the roles of visualization (including directing the user's attention) and music playback (hearing the score).  OMR is just one of many computer vision problems that fall into the constrained optimization category, and the approach also applies to natural language processing, machine listening, and others; the essential process to be explored here would extend to these domains as well, providing a general template with far-reaching significance.  For OMR the constraints are individual pixel labels, but for other problem domains they could equally well refer to labelling of individual samples, words, or whatever fundamental units compose the data.  In this way, the approach uses a generic and flexible view for human input that doesn't require the human to understand the inner workings of the recognition processes."

In this project, the PI will explore the use of new technology such as the Kinect to address this issue, by developing techniques for ""touchless"" interaction to coordinate and enhance communication among team members in the operating room.  The results of this research will provide a deeper understanding of collaborative practices around image use and the benefit of technological tools for annotating and referencing those images, which will significantly benefit patient outcomes.  The findings will have broad impact, in that they will be translatable to other expert collaborative environments that utilize imagery in order to have a positive effect on team work practices.  The PI will disseminate project outcomes broadly to both the medical and the human-computer interaction (HCI) communities.<br/><br/>An understanding of how new imaging interaction techniques can be integrated into and, in turn, shape coordinated practice will constitute an important contribution to the state of the art.  To achieve these goals, the PI will identify coordinated practices and their relationship to imaging use through a detailed field study of laparoscopic surgery.  She will then iteratively design and implement a gestural image annotation prototype for laparoscopic surgeons to reference and annotate endoscopic video.

Developing humanoid robots pushes robotics and automation technology forward. Researchers build humanoid robots to test and explore their theories about how humans work. Humanoid robots are beginning to play an economically important role in the service segment of our society. Primarily, humanoid robots inspire. For example Japan is publicizing its humanoid robotics research to get more children interested in science and engineering, currently a major concern in the U.S.<br/><br/>The PIs will purchase an upper body humanoid from Sarcos Research Corporation as well as two smaller robots and an advanced interface device. Using the proposed equipment, the PIs will undertake a number of projects which fall into four broad classes: core robotics and vision research that substantially increases the capabilities and skills of robots (Atkeson, Hebert, Rizzi, Pollard), authoring tools that will make it easier for people who are not roboticists and perhaps even not programmers to develop new applications on robots (Hodgins, Hudson, Kuffner), application prototyping and assessment of humanoid robots in various application domains (Pausch, Kiesler), and unifying applications, which involve a large number of interdisciplinary researchers. In addition to the expected robotics researchers, the team includes researchers from HCI and sociology to work on how these robots might be made easy to use and how they will fit into society. Taken together, these projects will significantly expand the ability both to control humanoid robots and to develop applications on them. These projects will also increase fundamental understanding of the power of the human form in a robot, and our fundamental understanding of human motion. The PIs will encourage other researchers at CMU and in the U.S. to use the facility, taking advantage of strengths in vision, speech, and reasoning. <br/><br/>Finally, the PIs are using humanoid robots to explore computational models of how human behavior is generated. Using a humanoid robot as a research tool forces the researchers to deal with a complex physical apparatus and complex tasks. The knowledge required to recreate human motions will also serve to increase our understanding of how people move and may lead to advances in physical rehabilitation and sports medicine. In contrast to most biomechanical research, the PIs will attempt to refine scientific understanding of both the functional components of human motion such as locomotion and grasping and also the subtle stylistic components that make it appear normal, humanlike, and expressive. Combining these two components should make the models useful for analyzing the performance of aspiring athletes as well as diagnosing individual problems with locomotion and manipulation.<br/>"

This project will explore the integration of paper and pixels for collaborative web design.   The PI will investigate tangible and pen interaction techniques to support collocated collaboration for creating information hierarchies, as well as tools and interactions that support versioning of a physical artifact as well as manipulation of the artifact when all or part of the physical representation is unavailable.   The PI will try to better understand virtual representations of a tangible information space for remote collaboration by creating a desktop GUI that allows remote users to see and manipulate the information space.   He will explore the use of a ""two-board UI"" for hybrid tangible/virtual interaction, where designers in physically distant places can collaborate through the artifact under design.  A strength of this project lies in its foundation in actual work practice, as observed by both the PI's  research group and others.  To insure the utility of the prototype system, the PI will conduct extensive evaluation of different areas of the system, and iterate system design based on these evaluations.  He will have designers create actual information architectures on the prototype running in the lab, and will also perform long term usability studies by deploying a working prototype of the system in a web design firm.   An outcome of the project will be a publicly available vision toolkit that can be used for tracking physical objects on a flat surface, and which will enable HCI researchers to create vision-based tangible user interfaces absent domain knowledge in computer vision.   The work will contribute a better understanding of techniques for combining tracked physical objects with an interactive display surface, and will also contribute new techniques for collocated and remote collaboration, as well as a better understanding of the means of interacting with large, physical information architectures."

The full-day event will take place on October 1, in conjunction with and immediately preceding the 2018 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC), to be held October 2-4 in Lisbon, Portugal and sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society.  This year marks the 34th anniversary of the Symposium.  Established in 1984, the mission of VL/HCC is to support the design, theory, application, and evaluation of computing technologies and languages for programming, modeling, and communicating, which are easier to learn, use, and understand by people.  This includes research aimed at visual technology and text, and technology that uses sound, taste, virtual reality, and the Web.  It also includes research on theories about the many media used toward this goal.  VL/HCC occupies a unique niche among HCI and programming language conferences, in that it focuses specifically on how to help end users successfully develop and use software.  More information about the Symposium may be found online at https://vlhcc18.github.io/.  The PI and the members of the organizing committee will make special efforts to attract a diverse and interdisciplinary group of student participants to the Graduate Consortium, with special attention paid to recruitment of students from underrepresented institutions and women.  <br/><br/>Recent advances in computing have led to continually deeper integration between computers and human society.  People now swim in a ""sea"" of socio-technical systems that synthesize large numbers of contributing users with vast amounts of source code.  Examples include social media systems, open source repositories, online marketplaces and massively multiplayer online games.  Yet as the socio-technical systems in this sea have grown in complexity, they have become increasingly difficult for end users to understand and direct toward productive ends.  The primary goal of this year's VL/HCC Graduate Consortium, the 16th to be funded by NSF in this series, is to stimulate graduate students' thinking about how to use tools and techniques in the early stages of problem solving such as problem definition and solution searching.  In particular, what methods, models, diagrams, and tools can people leverage to create mental models of complex socio-technical systems that can be used to make design decisions and for collaboration?  Effective approaches will bring users and software together in creative and productive ways that bear directly on the needs of modern society.  The student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop and will receive constructive feedback from the faculty participants as well as from the other students.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether the results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  This event will therefore promote discovery and learning, while also building community among young researchers working from the perspectives of diverse fields including computer science, the social sciences, and education.  To get feedback from a broader slice of the VL/HCC community, every student participant will present a poster or demo at the Showpieces event during the main conference. An extended abstract of each student participant's work will be published in the conference proceedings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The instrument at Fairbanks will be a very high spectral resolution solar absorption spectrometer.  This instrument covers the range 2.5 to 15 (m.  At least 30 chemical compounds have absorptions in the instrument bandpass.  This permits the derivation of total atmospheric quantities of those gases. The very high spectral resolution permits recovery of altitude profile information for at least half a dozen gases, including ozone, HCI, HF, and N2O.  This information will be used to study stratospheric chemistry and dynamics, and will be compared with data from McMurdo Station, Antarctic and other northern hemisphere sites.  Fairbanks is usually outside of the stratospheric polar vortex, but is in the area where maximum leakage of vortex air occurs.  This allows the study of filaments of materials with different temperature, sunlight, and chemical conditioning.    The Eureka, NWT, Canada (80(N, 86(W) instrument is a medium spectral resolution system designed to measure the infrared thermal emission of the atmosphere.  This instrument covers 6 to 15(m.  The atmosphere is very cold, and the signal is small, but measurements can be made in the absence of sunlight.  Eureka is usually on the edge of the polar vortex, allowing observations in and out of vortex conditions within a few days.  The amounts of several gases can be determined from the observations, particularly HNO3, which is directly involved in the formation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSC) and the chemical processing that occurs in ozone destroying conditions. The spectral data also relate directly to the greenhouse effect, and will be used to study the effect of chemistry, clouds, and snow on the radiation balance.    Both instruments will be used for the study of chemical processes that occur in the Arctic during the winter.  The multiyear data set will be important in the study of seasonal cycles, and in  the study of global change."

The system relies on wearable sensing and computing devices to achieve human context awareness. The research aims to answer central questions in understanding the interplay between human and computing, mainly <br/>- Understanding human context (e.g., behavior, location) through embedded computing, and<br/>- Exploring the knowledge of human context to improve embedded computing applications.<br/>The first research project investigates the development of infrastructure ?free human context awareness in GPS-restricted environments. The second studies the use of the knowledge of human context to better understand human intentions and addresses the study in a human-robot interaction (HRI) setup. Both projects require a motion capture system that can provide location ground truth, allow performance comparison, and facilitate system calibration. The work aims to <br/>- Develop a theoretical framework to achieve a stand-alone human context awareness that requires zero infrastructure setup.  (Some activities, such as 'virtual landmarks' are expected to contribute in indoor human localization.)<br/>- Develop explicit human intention recognition based in the context of both location and activity that pushes forward research in human-robot interaction <br/>- Lead to a better understanding of interactive, coupled relationship between human and computing.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The work impacts wearable computing, human-computer interaction (HCI), and ubiquitous computing research. Modifications of the developed hardware and software might serve to track the locations and monitor the status (activity and health) of first responders, improving the efficiency of personnel safety in their operations. The system improves the research capabilities in Oklahoma, an EPSCoR state.  Planned education and training activities contribute in preparing students in embedded computing, wireless communication, signal processing, and human behaviors. Outreach activities stimulate prospective students. Efforts will be made to involve Native American and female students."

This understanding is crucial to the development of better models of human-object and human-human interaction, and to the development of interface strategies to support next-generation systems for human-computer interaction. In addition to providing data addressing basic theoretical questions, the equipment will also foster the development of practical HCI applications, such as interfaces that better support social and physical interaction by using full body motion or by sensing and adapting to emotional states.

The long-running VL/HCC series occupies a unique niche among HCI and Programming Language conferences, in that it focuses specifically on how to help end users successfully develop and use software.  The diversity and ubiquity of people's goals, interactions, and concerns with information systems is continually increasing.  Not only does interactive computer software permeate many individuals' working lives, people commonly rely on computing and information systems for leisure and home activities as well.  As a result, end users now expect considerable flexibility and control in their interactions with computer software.  For many, it is no longer sufficient to consume the packaged software and scripted tasks developed by the professional software industry; they now must create their own computational solutions to a wide variety of problems, including spreadsheet models, web sites, educational media and simulations, automated business procedures, and visualizations.  To produce such software, even for domain-specific problems, end users must look beyond surface-level interaction with computers and acquire the conceptual models and skills of computational thinking.  But current advances toward computational thinking by end users are not evenly distributed across all segments of the population.  Thus, this year's VL/HCC Doctoral Consortium, the eighth to be funded by NSF in this series, will focus on expanding the benefits of computational thinking to diverse populations.  Ensuring that designers of computational languages and tools consider the needs of populations historically overlooked in information technology will increase the chance that these individuals/groups are able to learn and use the more powerful tools that are fast becoming essential to information literacy.  At the same time, such efforts may lead researchers to identify new software construction metaphors and techniques that increase the usability of their languages and environments more generally.  The workshop's primary goal is to stimulate graduate students' and other researchers' thinking about how varying communication media, representations, and problem-solving support affect end users' willingness and ability to access, manipulate, and program solutions to their work or everyday problems.  What are the special needs of disadvantaged populations?  How can computational problem-solving tools and devices be designed to meet these needs?  The workshop will bring together and build community among young researchers working on different aspects of these problems from the perspectives of diverse fields including computer science, the social sciences, and education.  It will guide the work of these new researchers by providing an opportunity for experts in the research field (as well as their peers) to give them advice, in that student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop and will receive feedback from a faculty panel.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether the results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  As in prior years the VL/HCC 2010 Doctoral Consortium will be part of the regular conference program.  A 2-page extended abstract of each participant's work will be published in the conference proceedings.    <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The workshop will help shape ongoing and future research projects aimed at alleviating a pressing problem of relevance to a great many people within our society. This event will promote discovery and learning, by encouraging the student researchers to explore a difficult and challenging open problem, through involvement of a panel of well-known researchers whose task is to provide constructive feedback, and through inclusion of other conference participants who will also learn from and provide additional feedback to the students and to each other.  The PI and the members of the organizing committee will make special efforts to attract a diverse and interdisciplinary group of student participants, with special attention paid to recruitment of women and minorities. The PI expects that most of the students supported by this award will come from U.S. universities but as in past years, due to the highly international make-up of the research community, a few non-U.S. students may be invited to participate as well.  As a testament to the success of previous workshops in this series, it is noteworthy that three of the past participants now hold tenure-track faculty positions, including the PI."

The event will take place in conjunction with the ACM 2017 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing, to be held in Portland, OR, on February 25-March 1, and which is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human Computer Interaction (SIGCHI).  The CSCW conferences are the premier venue for the presentation of research relating to the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities and networks (including collaborative systems and social computing).  The development and application of new technologies continues to enable new ways of working together and coordinating activities. Although work is an important area of focus for the conference, technology is increasingly supporting a wide range of recreational and social activities. CSCW has also embraced an increasing range of devices, as we collaborate from different contexts and situations.  Research published at CSCW is heavily refereed and widely cited; ranked as the second most impactful HCI conference by Google Scholar Metrics (after CHI), the 2016 event was attended by approximately 700 top researchers from academia and industry around the world.  CSCW 2017 will be the 20th conference in the series; more information may be found online at http://cscw.acm.org/2017/index.php.  The CSCW doctoral consortia, which began in 1992, have been highly successful in providing a forum for the initial socialization into the field of young doctoral scholars, and many of today's leading CSCW researchers participated as students in earlier consortia. These doctoral consortia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of CSCW researchers, allowing them both to sharpen the research skills and to create a social network among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development. Maintaining and fostering research dialog among the diverse disciplines that are present in the CSCW community results in synergistic and transformative research collaborations. Because the students and faculty constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, including nationality/cultural and scientific discipline, the students' horizons are broadened to the future benefit of the field.<br/><br/>The Doctoral Colloquium at CSCW 2017 will be a 1.5-day event taking place on Saturday and Sunday, February 25-26.  Goals of the doctoral colloquium include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the research field mentor them and provide constructive advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference. The first day of the Colloquium will be an afternoon session to allow participants a chance to get to know one another with structured small-group activities, including modeling the tradition of practice talks and providing one another with feedback on their presentations.  Students who were paired for pre-colloquium feedback will listen to one another's talks and provide feedback.  Practice talks are a tradition in research labs with strong mentoring and training cultures; the Doctoral Colloquium will model this practice for students who may not be part of a large research lab.  During the second day, each student will make a formal 10-minute presentation about his or her doctoral research, culminating in a 20-minute session of discussion and feedback (both from members of the faculty panel and other student participants) on the work.  The feedback will be geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other CSCW research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  Additional feedback will be provided by faculty panel members in informal one-on-one discussions during meal times, break times, and throughout the remainder of the conference.  An informal working lunch will include an ""interrogating research life"" panel, in which mentors will give short statements and students will be encouraged to ask questions about different aspects of research life, including research career paths, funding, work-life balance, etc.  Follow-up activities (including poster sessions) will take place during the conference's main technical program.  Doctoral colloquium papers will be published in the Extended Abstracts for the conference, which will be available to attendees and online; in this way, the students' work will be disseminated in a more enduring form.  The organizing committee will take proactive steps to ensure diversity and increase participation from institutions and ethnic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented at CSCW; in particular, they will limit acceptances to a maximum of two students from the same institution."

As a consequence of these studies, she has observed several problems arising from current designs: users do not switch modes effectively; users are unable to intervene after a long period of autonomy; users have a lack of situation awareness; information is presented ineffectively; and bystanders are confused when the robot acts in an unexpected fashion.  Based upon these issues, the PI has identified four challenge areas for interacting with autonomous systems: blending user and robot inputs to create sliding scale autonomy; automatically changing autonomy levels; summarizing robot state and past actions; and interacting with bystanders.  During the first three year of this project, the PI will design systems and conduct experiments in and effort to find answers to these challenge areas.  She will test her theories in two robot applications: urban search and rescue, which requires the operator to be remotely located; and robotic wheelchairs, where the operator is sitting on the robot and bystanders can be affected by the operation of the system.   In the final two years of the project, the PI will validate her theories in a third application: a robot assistant for the elderly or disabled.  Throughout the grant period, the research will be integrated into courses (undergraduate as well as graduate), as well as outreach activities in middle and high schools.  The PI will also develop a new course, Interacting with Autonomous Systems, which will address both human-computer interaction (HCI) and human-robot interaction (HRI).  The intellectual merits of this project includes: formulation and testing of theories for determining how to appropriately set and switch autonomy levels for robotic systems; creation of methods for blending autonomy levels to create new autonomy levels; development of an improved understanding of interaction with robotic systems; and validation of all hypotheses through the development of a new robotic system.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  All of the robot application areas to be explored in this research have the potential to impact society.  The theories regarding interacting with autonomy will apply to non-robotic systems as well, including space systems such as life support.  Inclusion of undergraduate students in the research will encourage them to pursue graduate studies, and the outreach program will introduce middle and high school students to robotics."

However, one limitation of television programming is that it is largely a one-way, non-interactive medium. Research suggests that children learn best through active engagement with content, and that parents can make TV watching more interactive by co-viewing and talking with their children. However, many parents and other adults may lack the time or experience and comfort with science language and content to provide critcial just-in-time support for their children. This study seeks to take advantage of recent advances in artificial intelligence that now allow children to enjoyably interact with automated conversational agents. The research team will explore whether such conversational agents, embedded as an on-screen character in a science video, can meaningfully interact with children about the science content of the show by simulating the benefits of co-viewing with an adult. If successful, the project could lay the foundation for a new genre of science shows, helping transform video watching into more interactive and engaging learning experiences. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.<br/><br/>This project will develop interactive videos incorporating a conversational agent in three 11-minute episodes of a future children's animated television program. The videos will enable children to speak with the main character of the show as the character solves everyday science mysteries, thus priming children to engage in observation, prediction, pattern finding, and problem solving through scaffolded conversation. This study will be carried out in two iterative cycles with the goal of developing and testing the embedded conversational function for each episode. In each cycle, the project team, which includes experts in children's TV production, as well as educational and HCI researchers will develop the storyboard and conversation prompts and follow-ups, create animated videos based on the revised script, and create a mobile application of the interactive video integrated with the conversational agent. Field testing with 10 children will be conducted to iteratively improve the embedded conversational function. In the pilot testing stage, a controlled study will be conducted with 30 children in each group (N=120): 1) watching the episode with the embedded conversational function; 2) watching the episode with a human partner carrying out the dialogue in the script rather than the virtual character; 3) watching the episode with pseudo-interaction, in which the animated character asks questions but does not attempt to understand or personally respond to children's answers; and 4) watching the episode with no dialogue. Data collected from the experiments will be used to examine whether and in what ways use of a conversational agent affects children's engagement, attention, communication strategies, perceptions, and science learning, and whether these effects vary by children's age, gender, socioeconomic status, language background, and oral language proficiency in English. The project will provide a comprehensive evaluation of the feasibility and potential of incorporating conversational agents into screen media to foster young children's STEM learning and engagement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Collaboration is involved in many societal problems including energy use, law enforcement, disaster relief, and scientific research.  Researchers in human-computer interaction and computer-supported cooperative work have an impressive record of developing technology to support interpersonal communication and group interaction in a range of problem areas such as medical team coordination, disruption of family schedules, multi-tasking and interruptions in the workplace, energy use in households, collaborative intelligence analysis, virtual organization, and collaborative learning.  Despite such efforts, the deep structure of collaboration is not well understood.  The goal of this project is to acquire instrumentation that will enable the PI and her colleagues to leverage advances in other disciplines such as neuroscience and engineering to advance our knowledge of how details of brain and behavior are related to the underlying meaning, processes, and outcomes of collaboration, that is, its deep structure.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The requested research infrastructure will allow future projects to include a focus on the fine details of human behavior, including brain responses, facial expressions, body positions, gestures, and movements.  The PI argues that in-depth analysis of behavior is necessary for understanding the mechanics of face-to-face interaction, for identifying those aspects of face-to-face interaction that are key to successful remote collaboration, for increasing the benefits of social media online, and for programming intelligent collaborative systems.  Availability for interaction in the home environment, for example, might be indicated by a combination of posture and facial expression; detailed knowledge of these indicators could then help us design systems that deliver notifications to families at appropriate times.  Similarly, remote experts collaborating around shared visualizations may benefit from camera systems that understand when partners have a shared understanding, as evidenced by their facial expressions and movements.  Human-robot interaction might be refined by a fine-grained analysis of human-human interactions such as handoffs and greetings.  And home health care and remote health delivery could be improved with better feedback about patient emotion and cognition during and after consultations.  The infrastructure to be acquired with this funding will provide a platform for exploring ways to achieve these goals.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The ability to understand the deep structures underlying collaboration has the potential to radically transform science and engineering in general, by furthering our ability to analyze contributors to effective team performance across many domains, and by laying the foundation for new collaborative interfaces that support interaction through gesture, facial expression, eye gaze and brain activity.  More specifically, there is a potential for direct broader impact in the domains of health and education.  In the domain of health, the new techniques will enhance ongoing work at the PI's institution on chronic illness management and home-health care, supporting better collaboration between parents and children with chronic illnesses, and patients and therapists through high fidelity patient observation.  In education, computer-supported and collaborative learning will advance by computer tutors understanding student attention and knowledge sharing in groups.   The instrumentation will also have local impact in the CMU HCI Institute, allowing faculty and student projects to include a focus on understanding the dynamics of collaboration and on the development of new tools to enhance people's ability to collaborate in diverse settings."

One key area of innovation has been tangible computing, which pushes the user interface beyond the screen into the physical world by means of mobile devices, graspable interfaces, physical computing, and interactive surfaces.  Closely related is embedded interaction in which the everyday objects and environments we interact with are computationally augmented in new ways.  As physical artifacts gain new computational behaviors, they become reprogrammable, customizable, repurposeable, and interoperable in rich ecologies and diverse contexts.  They also become more complex, and require intense design effort in order to be functional, usable, and enjoyable. Designing such systems requires interdisciplinary thinking, and making them encompasses not only technical knowledge of software, electronics, and mechanics, but also the use implications of a system's physical form and behavior as well as its impacts on society.<br/><br/>This is funding to support a research consortium (workshop) of approximately a dozen promising doctoral students from the United States and abroad, along with distinguished research faculty.  The event will take place in conjunction with the ACM SIGCHI TEI-10 conference, which will be held January 25-27, 2010, at the MIT Media Lab in Cambridge, MA.  Launched in 2007 and now in its fourth year, the TEI conference series brings together researchers, designers, engineers, and artists who are working in the emerging field of tangible, embedded, and embodied interaction.  It provides a meeting ground for the diverse communities of research and practice involved with tangibles, spanning topics ranging from computing, hardware, and sensor technology, to HCI, interaction design, and CSCW, to product and industrial design and interactive arts.  The intimate size of this single-track conference (about 150 participants annually) provides a unique forum for exchanging ideas through talks, interactive exhibits, demos, posters, art installations and performances. The Web site for the conference is http://www.tei-conf.org/10.<br/><br/>The TEI-10 Graduate Student Symposium, which will immediately precede the main conference on Sunday, January 24, will invite twelve graduate students from TEI fields to participate in a critical discussion and review of their work with four faculty mentors.  Students will present their work in posters at the conference and their short papers will be included in the conference Proceedings.  In addition, students enrolled in the Graduate Student Consortium will have the opportunity to review their research with their peers and with four faculty mentors experienced in the field who will constructively critique the students' work from diverse viewpoints.   <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  This workshop will sharpen the research skills of a new generation of scientists, engineers, and designers who will shape human-centered computing as it takes place in physical things and places.  Already we are observing the impact of this field in our daily lives, as computing becomes embedded in our phones, our bus stops, and soon even our clothing. Now is a critical moment in the field, as a wave of early exploratory prototypes begins to give way to disciplined investigations, the development of toolkits, and more rigorous evaluation methods.  Mentoring a next generation of TEI researchers is crucial if the field is to retain its initial vigor and openness as it gains foothold in the academic establishment of human-computing research.  The Graduate Student Consortium will broaden participation in the TEI 2010 conference by enabling 12 young scholars to attend. The TEI organizing committee will make special efforts to recruit a diverse set of student participants, particularly seeking members of groups that are under-represented in computer and information science and engineering, including women and members of U.S. minority populations. The committee is particularly concerned with increasing participation of underrepresented groups and will also ensure that the meeting is accessible to participants with disabilities."

The project is founded on the concept of tool use, in which handheld tool objects are used to modify the properties or appearance of target objects. The project integrates a wide range of findings in human-computer interaction and visualization, from bimanual and tangible user interfaces to augmented reality. At the core of this research endeavor is a desktop augmented reality system with a stereoscopic or monoscopic display, a haptic pointing device, and a camera focused on the user's hands. In one hand the user holds a physical wireframe cube that contains virtual objects, and in the other hand the pointing device, its tip visually augmented to show its function, which will relate to one of several possible tools, including: (a) a probe for pointing at, selecting, and moving objects, (b) a magnifying or semantic lens for filtering, recoding, and elaborating information, and (c) a cutting plane that shows slices or projection views. On the display, users watch the immediate, direct effects of their actions with the tools on the simulated object. The system will support visualization with fluid and natural interaction techniques, improving the ability of users to explore and understand 3D objects to some extent as if they were holding the objects in their hands. The project will provide societal benefits by generating theoretical and practical advances across multiple disciplines, such as a deeper understanding of the psychological theory and computer algorithms that are needed to give a person a seamless impression that he or she is manipulating an object that appears to be physically in front of the person, but which is only there virtually. It should be relatively straightforward to transition the practical outcome of this work to low-cost hardware components such as head-mounted 3D displays, such that the project could ultimately provide everyday users with a means of directly creating and modifying objects that they have in mind for 3D printing. University students will help to develop and evaluate the system, thus exposing these students to a new and potentially transformative approach to augmenting a simulated space with physical tools, and thus providing a larger population of students with opportunities for exciting hands-on computer science learning. Orthopedic surgeons have been recruited to assist in exploring the use of the system for preoperative surgical planning such as by permitting the exploration of complex 3D bone structures.<br/><br/>Development and evaluation of the novel interaction techniques in this hands-on augmented reality system will lead to a better understanding of how performance may be improved in data exploration with augmented tool use.  The research will investigate: the spatial collocation of user actions and system effects; physical constraints between the hands, objects, and the environment; and a greater role for proprioception. Experimental results will give insight into questions that cross the boundaries between relatively disparate areas of research in HCI and visualization, specifically the potential benefits of proprioception in bimanual tasks, the extent to which mechanical constraints and stabilization can improve performance in precise interaction tasks, and how these factors may compensate for the visual errors associated with presenting 3D information on a stereo or monoscopic display. The research will extend beyond the laboratory to a real and important medical domain, which will help validate our work in practice."

The event will take place in conjunction with the 2012 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC 2012), to be held September 30-October 4, 2012, in Innsbruck, Austria, and sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society.  The long-running VL/HCC series occupies a unique niche among HCI and Programming Language conferences, in that it focuses specifically on how to help end users successfully develop and use software.  Recent advances in computing have led to continually deeper integration between computers and human society.  People now swim in a ""sea"" of socio-technical systems that synthesize large numbers of contributing users with vast amounts of source code.  Examples include social media systems, open source repositories, online marketplaces and massively multiplayer online games.  Yet as the socio-technical systems in this sea have grown in complexity, they have become increasingly difficult for end users to understand and direct toward productive ends.  <br/><br/>The primary goal of this year's VL/HCC Doctoral Consortium, the tenth to be funded by NSF in this series, is to stimulate graduate students' and other researchers' thinking about how to make computation easier to express, manipulate, and understand.  In particular, what methods, models and tools can people use to visualize, analyze, tailor, and direct socio-technical systems?  The doctoral consortium aims to stimulate novel approaches that go far beyond simplistic solutions like web browsers and search engines.  Although search engines do provide information that is useful in simple situations, they represent only one portion of a socio-technical system (information retrieval).  For example, search engines alone are not powerful enough to be used to start new businesses and run them competitively, since they only give people the ability to find resources provided by other people, rather than the ability to create new resources.  Effective approaches will bring users and software together in creative and productive ways that bear directly on the needs of modern society.  <br/><br/>The workshop will build community among young researchers working on different aspects of these problems from the perspectives of diverse fields including computer science, the social sciences, and education.  It will guide the work of these new researchers by providing an opportunity for experts in the research field (as well as their peers) to give them advice, in that student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop and will receive feedback from a faculty panel.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether the results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  As in prior years the VL/HCC 2012 Doctoral Consortium will be part of the regular conference program.  A 2-page extended abstract of each participant's work will be published in the conference proceedings.  More information about this year's VL/HCC conference may be found at http://vlhcc2012.di.unisa.it.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The workshop will help shape ongoing and future research projects aimed at alleviating a pressing problem of relevance to a great many people within our society. This event will promote discovery and learning, by encouraging the student researchers to explore a difficult and challenging open problem, through involvement of a panel of well-known researchers whose task is to provide constructive feedback, and through inclusion of other conference participants who will also learn from and provide additional feedback to the students and to each other.  The PI and the members of the organizing committee will make special efforts to attract a diverse and interdisciplinary group of student participants, with special attention paid to recruitment of students from underrepresented institutions and women. The PI expects that most of the students supported by this award will come from U.S. universities (no more than 2 will be accepted from any one institution), but as in past years due to the highly international make-up of the research community a couple of non-U.S. students may be invited to participate as well."

Highly charged ions are atoms in which all or most of their electrons have been stripped and the remaining electron(s) exist in the extremely large electric field of the nucleus. Measurements of electronic transitions in these systems provide stringent tests of physics predictions in extreme conditions.  Rydberg highly charged ions, in which the remaining electron is in a highly excited state, will be the focus of this project. These systems provide test beds for measurement of fundamental constants, quantum information processing schemes, precision tests of quantum electrodynamics, and precision X-ray wavelength standards. The formation of such extreme electronic states is not straightforward, due to excitation energies that are many orders of magnitude higher than that of ordinary laser accessible transitions.  The research activity also involves training of next generation scientists in atomic physics, spectroscopy, data analysis, scientific research, and scientific communication.  In addition to graduate students, this team will mentor undergraduate students through Clemson University's on-campus research initiatives such as the Creative Inquiry program for current students and the Eureka! program for incoming undergraduates.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this research is to create and investigate Rydberg highly charged ions (RyHCI) in which a single electron occupies high principle quantum number states. Single electron capture from colliding neutral atoms into the Rydberg levels of bare nuclei will be employed as a production mechanism for these unique H-like systems. The charge exchange process that leads to the formation of these one-electron ions is far from being fully understood, and therefore the results will also contribute to the understanding of this important problem in atomic physics. This team will create HCI beams of different kinetic energies at the Clemson University Electron Beam Ion Trap (CUEBIT) facility and intersect them with different neutral atoms of a gas jet target. High-resolution and broadband X-ray spectrometers will be used to observe transitions directly to the ground state simultaneously with alternative cascade channels. Spectral lines in RyHCI will serve as signatures for the initial (n,l) distribution of the electron capture.  Additionally, this team will collaborate with theoreticians to use a collisional cascade model to determine the site distribution of the initial capture and compare their findings with theoretical calculations including classical trajectory Monte Carlo simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Building on this work and motivated by the need of our nation to further engage children in STEM, this research investigates how to design age-appropriate reality-based interfaces that engage young children in scientific investigations, bio-design, and engineering. The project entails the development of novel human-computer interfaces that encourage children to explore and design within the domain of biological engineering, while facilitating learning of abstract concepts in a concrete way. This approach intends to promote a re-examination of the early childhood STEM curriculum to include emerging and interdisciplinary topics.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The project scope includes the design, implementation, and evaluation of RBIs for young children that support collaborative exploration of biological engineering. The research questions investigated focus on how reality-based interaction techniques can be applied to make the invisible tangible. Specifically, how to design novel interaction techniques that bridge the time and size scales of biology? How to design and implement interfaces that supports collaboration within both pairs and larger groups by integrating computational devices of different scales? How to support seamless transition between macroscopic and microscopic levels of information and across multiple devices? And finally, can RBIs allow young children to grasp abstract concepts that were previously considered too complex for their age and developmental stage? The outcomes of this project contribute to four areas of research: 1) tangible and embodied interaction, 2) computer supported collaborative learning, 3) interaction design for children, and 4) early childhood education in STEM."

The CSST resulted from recognition of the growing importance of research on the interplay of humans and technology. The science of socio-technical systems (SST) is fundamental to the rapidly growing ""virtual organizations"" thematic area, among others; thus, the urgent national need for research that is firmly grounded in the SST tradition. Yet this community of scholars, which includes faculty in diverse fields such as social informatics, social computing, CSCW, computational social science, HCI, and information science, remains fractured and largely invisible. The CSST series of Summer Research Institutes is a critical step toward unifying this diverse community and enhancing its visibility, by providing an immersive experience for the next generation of SST leaders (both advanced doctoral students and pre-tenure faculty) so that they will be well prepared to engage in distributed scientific inquiry. The Summer Research Institutes build critical intellectual and social capital by fostering creation of a cohort group of new researchers whose work is shaped by hearing experts in socio-technical systems research provide encouragement and give advice on how to advance the field's intellectual basis, methodological approaches, and potential for sustained, meaningful and even transformative impact. Increasingly, the iConference has become a showcase for Summer Research Institute alumni; for example, in 2011 more than one third of all events involved a sociotechnical scholar and Summer Research Institute alumni. <br/><br/>The 2016 workshop will adhere to the successful format that has evolved and been refined over the course of the prior Summer Research Institutes. The workshop will bring together early career researchers selected through a competitive review process with a set of more senior researchers for an intensive five-day research exchange. The event will be residential and located in a semi-isolated locale to encourage the maximum amount of social interaction among participants. Senior faculty, junior faculty, and advanced doctoral students will collectively strive to articulate in more coherent and contemporary forms the basic principles, goals and approaches to doing socio-technical science across a range of relevant intellectual communities. They will explore topics and methods for advancing the science of socio-technical systems, while focusing on intellectual development of individual research that is aligned with core aspects of the socio-technical perspective. More than 68 accomplished senior scholars and 240 promising junior investigators have participated in the previous eight CSST Summer Research Institutes The diversity of participants across a number of dimensions (e.g., institutional, disciplinary, geographic, gender, minority group status), serves to broaden participants' perspectives at a critical stage in their careers. The immersive intellectual experience during the workshop will facilitate creation of a social network among the participants and the senior researchers who serve as Institute instructors. This network will play a major role both in the professional development of the participants and in the evolution of the field of socio-technical systems research."

Although there have been great advances in the compression and transfer of audio and video signals for telecommunication, there is still a significant challenge in providing the appropriate tools for conveying expert knowledge in distributed work settings.  Surgical telemedicine is one domain where collaborative interaction with highly specialized images is vital for the efficient and effective conveyance of expert information, and the collaborating individuals may not have the same level of expertise.  In this research the PI will systematically ascertain the challenges of expert distributed communication of technical images and the benefits that collaborative image interaction has in conveying expert knowledge in distributed work.  Because the findings from this research will be translatable to other expert distributed environments that utilize imagery in order to have a positive effect on distributed collaborative work practices, project outcomes will have broad implications aside from the immediate benefit of providing manipulation and annotation ability on images for distributed collaborative work to support healthcare.  The project will provide educational experiences at multiple levels by including high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in this interdisciplinary research.  Because the PI will actively engage and mentor under-represented groups throughout the project, the work may also increase the number of underrepresented minorities and women in science and technology.  Finally, the PI will disseminate results broadly in both the medical and HCI literature, and coordinate workshops at the respective yearly conferences, in order to engage a wider audience of researchers and system designers.<br/><br/>This work is part of a long term effort by the PI in investigating how images play a part in scientific and medical collaborative practices, particularly with regards to how both professionals and lay people perceive the information through images and, in turn, the effects of new mechanisms for sensing, presenting, and interacting with those images.  The research aims are: to determine the verbal and non-verbal mechanisms for conveying expert knowledge in co-located and distributed collaboration with images; to develop a prototype for distributed collaborative image interaction; to determine the effects of collaborative image interaction on expert communication processes and performance outcomes; and to determine the effects of and the reactions to collaborative image interaction on distributed work practices.  The educational objective is to produce scholars with a deep understanding of collaborative technology design and social science evaluation on health information system success.  This is part of a long-term effort by the PI to engage under-represented groups in computer and information science by exposing them to the process of developing technology solutions to real world problems.  Specific educational activities will include development of an internship program for high school students to participate in research and systems design on the real-world problems of the operating room, and development of a cross-listed graduate course on telemedicine that utilizes a project-based curriculum to bring together the expertise of graduate students from three different UMBC graduate programs: Information Systems, Human Centered Computing, and Health IT."

The full-day event will take place on October 11, in conjunction with and immediately preceding the 2017 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC), to be held October 12-14 in Raleigh, NC, and sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society.  This year marks the 33rd anniversary of the Symposium.  Established in 1984, the mission of VL/HCC is to support the design, theory, application, and evaluation of computing technologies and languages for programming, modeling, and communicating, which are easier to learn, use, and understand by people.  This includes research aimed at visual technology and text, and technology that uses sound, taste, virtual reality, and the Web.  It also includes research on theories about the many media used toward this goal.  VL/HCC occupies a unique niche among HCI and programming language conferences, in that it focuses specifically on how to help end users successfully develop and use software.  More information about the Symposium may be found online at https://sites.google.com/site/vlhcc2017/.  The PI and the members of the organizing committee will make special efforts to attract a diverse and interdisciplinary group of student participants to the Graduate Consortium, with special attention paid to recruitment of students from underrepresented institutions and women.  To further increase diversity, no more than two student participants will be accepted from any given institution (and if two, then at least one of them must be from an under-represented group in STEM fields).<br/><br/>Recent advances in computing have led to continually deeper integration between computers and human society.  People now swim in a ""sea"" of socio-technical systems that synthesize large numbers of contributing users with vast amounts of source code.  Examples include social media systems, open source repositories, online marketplaces and massively multiplayer online games.  Yet as the socio-technical systems in this sea have grown in complexity, they have become increasingly difficult for end users to understand and direct toward productive ends.  The primary goal of this year's VL/HCC Graduate Consortium, the 15th to be funded by NSF in this series, is to stimulate graduate students' thinking about how to use tools and techniques in the early stages of problem solving such as problem definition and solution searching.  In particular, what methods, models, diagrams, and tools can people leverage to create mental models of complex socio-technical systems that can be used to make design decisions and for collaboration?  Effective approaches will bring users and software together in creative and productive ways that bear directly on the needs of modern society.   The Graduate Consortium will help shape ongoing and future research projects aimed at alleviating a pressing problem of relevance to a great many people within our society.  The student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop and will receive constructive feedback from the faculty participants as well as from the other students.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether the results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  This event will therefore promote discovery and learning, while also building community among young researchers working from the perspectives of diverse fields including computer science, the social sciences, and education.  To get feedback from a broader slice of the VL/HCC community, every student participant will present a poster or demo at the Showpieces event during the main conference. A 2-page extended abstract of each student participant's work will be published in the conference proceedings."

Devices will carry out a wide range of experimentation, from tightly controlled experiments to broad field studies, from previously planned extensions of existing research to last-minute ideas created by student projects, and from small pilot studies to large deployment studies. The infrastructure supports research projects in human computer interaction (HCI), recommender systems, and spatial data management for environments where users are mobile; specifically, <br/>Ubiquitous Peripheral Social Interaction (UPSI), <br/>Location-Aware Recommender Systems, and<br/>Spatial Data Management for Location Aware Mobile Computing.<br/>The first project presumes availability of several wireless communication channels. Information, at the periphery of users' attention, is constantly streamed to the device and displayed as a scrolling ""ticker."" A user carries a pocket computer and wears a Networked Wrist Device linked by Bluetooth. This approach presents challenges in populating and managing the information model driving the interaction, designing the interface for the networked wrist display, coupling the wrist computer and PDA, and identifying the types of tasks for which this interaction paradigm is suitable. Using algorithmic and interface research, pilot tests, real-world experiments, and metrics, the second project looks into suitable applications among wired, disconnected, and wireless connected recommenders. Given local and temporal patterns of users, this project examines when it is appropriate to interrupt its user with a recommendation, how to present recommendations most effectively across multi-device interfaces, and how to compute recommendations when the user is disconnected from the network. The last project looks into the requirements of spatial data management systems for applications like mobile location based recommendation systems. The project gathers a trace-based workload from location aware recommendation systems to evaluate solutions for critical design decisions such as algorithms for map compression and predictive pre-fetching strategies to cache relevant segments of maps based on past spatial queries, scheduled meetings locations, and related information. The educational plan includes integration of the platform into courses and student involvement in summer internships.<br/>"

The event, the 5th annual doctoral consortium on Sociotechnical Issues in Medical Informatics, will take place in conjunction with the 2011 Annual Symposium of the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) in Washington DC on October 22-26.  The AMIA Symposium, held every fall, is the world's most comprehensive annual meeting and premier forum on biomedical and health informatics, attracting over 2,000 researchers, professionals and students from an array of occupational settings who are interested in all aspects of health information technologies.  More information about the conference may be found at https://www.amia.org/amia2011. <br/><br/>One issue that is of particular importance within medical informatics is the need to design/deploy systems with an understanding of how these systems fit into organizational and social contexts.  The term sociotechnical denotes the importance of considering technical and organizational/social issues together rather than in isolation.  For instance, the medical informatics community has long been interested in the technical features of the Electronic Medical Record (EMR), but less attention has been paid to how the design of the EMR will be affected by who the primary users of the system are, what context it is used in, and what interactions it should support.  Yet, to design effective EMR systems, we need to understand how these different issues impact each other.  The growing need for integrating research across disciplines (e.g., HCI and Medical Informatics) is the primary motivation for this doctoral consortium.  Therefore, student participants will span a broad range of disciplines and approaches that inform medical informatics, including computer science, information science, engineering, clinical sciences, law, management and related fields.  The doctoral consortium will take place on the weekend prior to the AMIA Symposium so the students can also participate in the conference, which will introduce them to the exciting breadth of research topics within the medical informatics community.  Conversely, bringing a new generation of scholars from different disciplines into the medical informatics community will broaden that community's understanding of what other research disciplines can offer medical informatics.<br/><br/>The consortium will provide a forum for doctoral students to share their work and also network with other doctoral students and researchers.  Student participants will give short presentations during the consortium and will receive constructive remarks and feedback on their research from prominent researchers as well as through interaction with other students.  The feedback is designed to help students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to related research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  Thus, the consortium will help shape both these ongoing and future inter- and multi-disciplinary research projects focusing on organizational and social issues surrounding health-related technologies.  The names and abstracts of the accepted participants will be printed in the AMIA program guide, and will also be made available to the public on a special website to be developed by the organizers.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The doctoral consortium will bring together people from different disciplines who might not otherwise engage with one another and will expose them to different scientific research approaches and questions.  It will foster a sense of community among the young researchers by allowing them to create a supportive mentoring and social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development.  The organizers will make a concerted and proactive effort to ensure a diverse pool of student participants including both strong international participation and members of under-represented groups in the STEM disciplines; this, in turn, will broaden the students' horizons to the future benefit of the field."

Conceptually, ubiquitous pixels envisions pixels being lit everywhere and anywhere around the user and are used both as information carriers and interaction agents. A system of ?sea of projectors and cameras? has been identified as the right medium to push the envelope to achieve this vision. But even after a decade, only a small part of the vision has been realized. The reason for this is the complexity of the problem and a common belief that many parts of the problem are intractable. This project involves an analysis of the feasibility of achieving ubiquitous pixels under various conditions of known and unknown display and device (projectors and cameras) parameters. The project will identify the aspects of the problem, if any, that are theoretically intractable as against those that are limited by current technology. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project will identify constraints and guidelines that would make ubiquitous pixels realizable to those on display surfaces, projectors, cameras and other sensors that are used in interactive environments. The project will specify the theoretical constraints that should be imposed on these devices that will make this problem tractable. The project will set a research agenda by identifying the fundamental set of physical features that need to be provided in the device and the environment to make ubiquitous pixels feasible.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The primary long-term impact of this proposal lies in advances made to realize ubiquitous pixels - pixels anywhere and everywhere. Ubiquitous pixels have a tremendous potential to change the way we interact with the environment in the future. Specifically, the project will advance the frontier of research to create pack-and-go high resolution displays where one can pack multiple display units at the back of their car trunk, deploy them on any environment in minutes, dismantle them and take them elsewhere when needed. It can also make advances for next generation visualization, training and simulation systems that are entirely seamless with an order of magnitude greater resolution than current displays (from millions to billion pixels by using hundreds of projectors) and can scale easily to accommodate the incredible rate of the growth of data in the recent years.<br/>"

In the new model, the programmer starts by providing simple diagrams and animations showing some of the high-level insight behind an implementation. After interacting with the user to clarify any potential omissions or inconsistencies, the system automatically derives a correct implementation.  The interactions are designed to expose gaps in the programmer's reasoning, and to capture new insights in the form of diagrams, invariants, or simple unit tests. As a result, the tool helps the programmer achieve an improved understanding of the problem in addition to delivering an implementation.<br/><br/>The new programming model is supported by a new breed of software synthesis algorithms that work by framing the synthesis problem as a constraint satisfaction problem. In this approach, the different forms of input provided by the programmer are independently translated into constraints. At the high-level, the approach is fairly simple; the challenge lies in finding efficient representations for both the program and the constraints.  The graphical formalisms in particular pose some interesting problems due to their many omissions, but a combination of abstract interpretation and demand-driven constraint generation make this problem tractable.<br/><br/>The new programming model embodies a human-centered approach to synthesis that could transform the way complex pieces of systems code are developed, and could show the way for a new generation of programming tools that combine formal methods with HCI to make programming easier and more reliable."

By one estimate, the number of end-user programmers in the United States is expected to reach 55 million by 2005, compared to only 2.75 million professional programmers.  Unfortunately, closed, uncustomizable applications have long been a serious obstacle for end-user programming on the desktop.  The recent migration of applications to the Web opens up a new vista of opportunity, in that applications that would have been closed and uncustomizable on the desktop sprout numerous hooks for customization when implemented for the Web.  In this project, the PI will seek to advance end-user automation and customization of the Web, by developing new interface designs, representations, algorithms, and tools.  The research will include fundamental advances in learning wrappers (patterns that identify components of web pages) from very few examples, so that users can demonstrate web automation by pointing and clicking.  Languages and techniques will be developed that allow users to customize web sites without examining their source code.  A safe environment for offline testing and debugging of web automation will be implemented, and techniques for integrating multiple web sites together seamlessly, so that pages displayed by one site automatically include context-sensitive information provided by another site, will be devised.  These fundamental contributions will form the basis for end-user customizations of web sites to make them more readable, easier to use for frequent tasks, and amenable to operations like sorting and filtering done in the web browser.  The capstone application of the proposed research will be a set of tools that support gathering web information to drive personal decisions, such as buying a car, finding a house, or choosing a job.  To achieve these goals, the PI will develop new algorithms for inferring patterns and scripts that interact with and extract information from the Web, design and evaluate new ways to customize users' web experiences, and seek to gain a deeper understanding of how people acquire web information to make personal decisions.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The outcomes of this project will equip end-users with more control over the accessibility and performance of their browsing experience, giving them more tools for making information-driven decisions about important issues, both personal and public, such as education, health care, public policy, safety, and the environment.  The software to be developed by the PI will be released free of charge as open-source tools for public use, and as infrastructure for other researchers in end-user programming.  The project will also expose a generation of MIT computer science graduates to HCI principles and techniques, so that as they move on to careers in software industry and academia, they produce more usable software; related course materials will be released for free, open, public use, as part of the MIT OpenCourseWare Initiative."

Physical movement has been shown to be a key preventative measure for back pain; individuals are better able to sit for prolonged periods when they can change their posture throughout the day.  The potential benefit of introducing healthy movement into daily computer use has led the PIs to fundamentally rethink current desktop computer design, with the goal of transforming its static nature to one that moves and invites movement.  In this project, the PIs will explore how movement-related benefits can be achieved in human-computer interaction, by designing and fabricating a prototype physically animated computer wherein the desktop monitor possesses the ability to move in subtly expressive ways that respond to its user.  Through a human subject study designed to investigate the ergonomics of a moving screen, the PIs will evaluate whether the user's movement can be increased while sitting at a computer without negatively impacting task performance or quality of experience.  Can the reciprocal movement of human and computer be designed to promote back health, without being distracting or annoying to the user?  Can such movement, and its interaction with affect and cognition, be designed to improve the efficacy of computer use?  The PIs believe this is possible in light of new theories in the literature that link physical posture and its influence on cognition and affect.  The outcome of this work will be a set of design principles for how to introduce healthy movement into effective desktop computer usage, as well as an initial theory for ergonomic movement in human-computer interaction.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  This work will establish a proof of concept for a novel technology, and will lay an initial and important theoretical foundation for new lines of research in HCI that explore the intriguing possibilities of incorporating ergonomic movement in human-computer interaction both for health benefits and also as a potential means to foster performance and learning gains."

Combating the reality of poor student-to-computer ratio in schools and occasional access to technology, handheld computers (sometimes referred to as PDAs) offer an intriguing, more pervasive solution to the computer access problem given their increasing functionality and decreasing costs.  However, technology aimed at learning must also be supportive of learner needs and be designed from a learner-centered perspective to develop scaffolds for those tools, with software features (e.g., prompts, process maps) that physically realize literature-based conceptual scaffolding strategies (e.g., ""visualize complex tasks"") aimed at supporting learners to mindfully do and learn complex new activities and content.   This project explores the design and assessment of effective scaffolds for handheld-based software tools in the context of science education.  While a significant research community has explored desktop-based scaffolds, we lack similar design information for handheld-based scaffolds.  User interface design decisions for desktop computers do not necessarily ""scale down"" to handheld computers due to differences in screen size, input methods, processor speed, etc., so new design guidelines are needed to develop handheld-based scaffolds.  In this study the PIs will engage in an established learner-centered design methodology to design scaffolds for four handheld-based science tools.  They will classroom test those tools in Detroit middle schools, and assess the impact of those scaffolds on student science work.  Design guidelines will be coupled with assessment about the ""effects with"" the scaffolds (i.e., how do students work with the individual scaffolds to do their work?) and the ""effects of"" the scaffolds (i.e., what did students learn after using the scaffolded tools?).  The main outcome will be to develop and articulate design guidelines about scaffolds for handheld computers.   <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The broader impacts of the proposed work are: to impact HCI research by shedding light on effective and ineffective user interface decisions for the ""non-desktop"" computational devices that are becoming more prevalent, and also by distilling a set of design guidelines that articulate different scaffolding approaches for handheld tools and assessment information (from classroom testing) describing the impact those scaffolds had on learners; to advance discovery while promoting teaching, training and learning by integrating research activities into science education and teaching at the K-12 level: to broaden participation of under-represented groups by bringing innovative technologies to under-represented classrooms in the Detroit Public Schools; and to enhance scientific and technological understanding by disseminating the resulting software, curricula, and assessment information to teachers, school board members, and other educational policy makers.<br/>"

It is the first tool built that empowers users to efficiently carry out both real-time and asynchronous conversations in the same system, with each user reading only those conversations that are important to them. In particular, the technology empowers teams to make decisions in virtual meetings that take place asynchronously over periods of hours or days. This is in contrast with existing group chat technology, where conversations usually end as soon as someone starts talking about something else. This ability to conduct long running, virtual meetings is invaluable for large teams that need to coordinate work across different locations and time zones. Large, distributed teams are fast becoming the norm for how organizations operate, as instant communication and globalization make such teams the workforce of the future. Coordinating the efforts of such teams is a huge pain point for companies, and this technology is a leap in the state of the art in this space.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has two key research objectives: scaling the technology to work for teams of size 10,000+, and determining the feasibility of porting the technology to mobile. A major scalability research area is search. The company envisions the technology to be the primary place where decisions are made, and hence a primary place where knowledge is stored, so fast, full-text search is important, despite the fact that chat generates much more traffic than email. One research area on mobile is the HCI challenge of displaying rich options for conversation navigation on a small mobile screen. The problem is unique to this technology, since having long running, asynchronous conversations means that users do not typically read messages in a strictly chronological fashion. The company anticipates the Phase I grant will enable it to develop a working solution to the search scalability problem, and a working prototype of a performant and productive mobile user experience."

Science depends on the creative mind.  So does the economic viability of nations today.  The goal of this grant is to open up a new frontier in human-robot interaction whereby it becomes possible to augment human creativity through human-robot interaction.  This possibility could emerge by embedding sophisticated search functions and AI software in a social robot, which then engages in dialog with the user, decides on key terms for a search, filters the results (based on unique and long-standing histories of the user), and decides which results to bring forward at specific junctions in the human-robot dialog.  <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:  There are four overarching goals: (1) To conceptualize the creativity domain and to generate creativity methods in human-robot interaction.  (2) To develop human-robot interaction patterns that set up (a) people's prior social relationships with a social robot such that people are open to creating with the robot, and (b) the interactions with the robot for the creative process itself.  (3) Piloting research toward fostering creativity in interaction with ATR's humanoid robot, Robovie.  And (4) conducting a formal research study to test new forms of creativity with ATR's humanoid robot, Robovie.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  This research will (1) lead to the mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students; (2) broaden the participation of females in HCI; and (3) promote the transfer of expert knowledge from a leading Japanese laboratory to the United States.  More broadly, (4) this new vision for HRI could be transformative insofar as over the next 3-10 years this form of human-robot interaction could provide an entirely new way that people generate new knowledge, and thereby help promote exponential growth in the sciences, as well as in some of the humanities."

However, passwords are either difficult to use (if they are long and randomly generated), or insecure (if users are given the choice of their own passwords). Password Managers are one promising approach aimed to improve the usability and security of passwords, by having a computing device, rather than the user herself, store (and optionally, generate) passwords, and then later deliver or recall them to the user whenever access is needed. A number of password management schemes have been proposed and are employed currently by many affected users. <br/><br/>This project concentrates on password management using mobile devices (e.g., cell phones), whose ubiquity makes them an appealing authentication aid.  It embarks upon two research directions vis-a-vis such phone managers.  First, the project aims at a systematic and formal evaluation, via usability studies and surveys, of currently deployed phone managers. Second, it proposes a redesign that exploits the many different capabilities and characteristics of modern phones (such as on-board sensors and computational resources), in order to address several of the drawbacks with current phone managers.  Specifically, a general-purpose password management approach -- called proxy-based authentication -- is introduced.  As the name suggests, this approach uses the phone as an authentication proxy between the user and the device to be authenticated to.  The project explores how proxy-based authentication can be used to strongly authenticate to: (1) critical online services -- that continue using passwords or PINs -- without incorporating any service-specific modifications, (2) local devices (such as desktops, laptops, ATMs), and (3) ubiquitous but constrained devices (such as personal RFID tags) for user-controlled privacy and enhanced security.<br/><br/>The technical merit of this project lies in two aspects. First, it will arrive at a better understanding of current phone managers in terms of usability, efficiency, and security. The goal is to gain insights into users' mental models when using these password managers.  Second, the project will pursue the realization of usable proxy-based authentication primitives.  To this end, this work is able to simply reuse wealth of existing research on usable user-phone authentication. Instead, the main thrust is on exploring the design and evaluation of usable authentication methods between the phone and the service that ultimately requires authentication.  In particular, for phone-service authentication, the project investigates novel short-range human-perceptible (HP) communication that is commonly and cheaply available, fast, robust, least intrusive, and  low-power.  Notably, the research investigates how to use HP communication to create authenticated channels, and authenticated and eavesdropping resilient channels.  Based on the principle of extrinsically motivated design, the project also explores playful HP channels.  These channels make the task of manual transmission a fun and entertaining activity for the users.<br/><br/>The anticipated impacts of the project include: (1) enhanced interaction among several disciplines including security and cryptography, computer and electrical engineering, networking, and usability and HCI; (2) increased awareness among students and users regarding security practices vis-a-vis one of the most important security problems (authentication); (3) integration of PI's research with educational activities, enabling students taking part in the project to acquire currently uncommon skills at the cusp of Human-Computer Interaction and Trustworthy Computing; (4) emphasis on  technology transfer by working with manufacturers and industrial consortia. Another long-term impact of this work is the development of security technologies that can eventually be put to use by general population, i.e., are usable in the true sense.  Furthermore, the work is expected to be instrumental in stimulating research on usable security technologies for the blind or visually impaired users who are usually at a high risk for various security vulnerabilities and attacks, perhaps more so in the context of authentication."

To date, sign language recognition has focused primarily on detecting individual signs (words), articulated primarily with the arms and hands. This is a major limitation, given that critical linguistic information-including grammatical features such as negation, agreement, and question status-is conveyed through ""non-manual"" linguistic markings.  These non-manual markings include facial expressions (such as raised or lowered eyebrows, varying gaze and aperture of the eyes, wrinkling of the nose, and mouth movements) and gestures or periodic movements of the head (such as tilts, nods, and shakes).  No system for sign language recognition or generation can succeed without properly modeling the linguistic information produced both manually and non-manually.<br/><br/>The fact that these critical non-manual behaviors occur in parallel with manual signing, and that they are temporally aligned with phrases rather than with individual signs, greatly complicates the task. Further problems arise because of the difficulties of tracking the minute details of human facial movements from video, and the variations in the specific realizations (style) of manual signs and non-manual linguistic markings across different individuals, just as there is variation in the specific ways in which individuals produce a given spoken language. A comprehensive approach to ASL recognition thus requires the integration of information from multiple data sources with different spatial and temporal scales, the application of linguistic knowledge about both the manual and the non-manual aspects of ASL, and the modeling of interdependencies of activities in the manual and non-manual channels.<br/><br/>This collaborative project brings together the expertise of researchers in the fields of computer vision, linguistics, and recognition to achieve its goals. On the computer vision side, the principal investigators (PIs) will investigate the use of local free-form deformations and novel registration methods to enhance our existing face tracking software, so as to capture the minute details of the facial movements, and to improve robustness of the tracking. The tracking process results in a large number of facial parameters, which the researchers propose to reduce through nonlinear subspace manifold embedding. This embedding reduces the dimensionality of the parameter space, and more importantly, also results in a separation of style and content. Whereas style is specific to each signer, content captures the commonalities across all signers. Hence, by focusing on the content component, the PIs expect to be able to overcome the variations across signers and perform signer-independent recognition.<br/><br/>On the recognition side, the researhcers will combine the linguistic knowledge about facial microactions with computational clustering approaches to develop the necessary statistical models for recognition. Initially, these will be based on Hidden Markov Models from previous work by this research group and elsewhere; however, their power to describe the dynamical aspects of human movements is limited. To overcome these limitations, the PIs will research the use of Switching Linear Dynamic Systems, augmented by Coupled Dynamic Bayesian Networks to model and capture the interactions of the simultaneously occurring microactions. Linguists and computer scientists will collaborate in exploring the best ways to leverage information about the linguistic organization of ASL for improvement of recognition strategies.<br/><br/>This research will be performed on the existing linguistically annotated corpus of the National Center for Sign Language and Gesture Resources, as well as new data to be collected from 5-8 native ASL signers, which will also be annotated over the course of the project. The annotations will be used for the linguistic modeling; they also provide the ""ground truth"" for performing and validating the computer vision and recognition research.<br/><br/>Broader impact: <br/>The computer-based techniques for ASL can be extended to more general systems for sign language recognition and generation, as well as for interpretation of other types of human movements, such as face gesture recognition for HCI, surveillance, verification of identity, interrogation, interviews and  medical diagnosis applications. The materials to be distributed will benefit researchers in linguistics, computer science, and other domains. There are immediate applications for primary and secondary education of the deaf and training of sign language interpreters. Improvements in multimedia (linguistic) information technology promise to offer expanded employment possibilities for the deaf, as well as improved access to vocational and post-secondary education. Finally, this project itself will provide a huge boost in terms of education, awareness and encouragement of deaf students in enabling them to work on cutting-edge research that directly affects them and their community.<br/>"

Robust domain-independent language understanding is essential for multilingual information extraction, summarization, question answering, and automatic translation.   With pervasive computing environments soon to come, language understanding will become even more indispensable for interacting with artifacts of widely different functionalities.   The field of natural language understanding has made significant progress in the last fifteen years.  A large part of this gain is due to the sophisticated combination of statistical algorithms with template-based algorithms tailored to specific domains like air-traffic information, travel scheduling, and business news.  But any real solution to the problem of domain-independent understanding will require moving beyond template-based monolingual systems to more flexible, general purpose HCI systems via three key innovations:    (1) a domain-independent semantic language as the back end for these understanding systems, replacing the current domain-restricted templates and slots;    (2) rich semantic lexical databases which are broad enough to cover the necessary words for language engineering tasks, and deep enough in usable semantic information to support true domain-independent understanding;    and (3) sophisticated techniques for performing this mapping.<br/><br/>This project will develop these three components:    a very large lexical database FrameNet++, a semantic language designed for domain-independent understanding tasks, and the tools for applying it to and evaluating it on key NLU applications.   The semantic language and lexical database are based on formalizing the semantic frames and the semantic and syntactic combinatory properties - the valences - of a significant portion of the English lexicon.    FrameNet++ will offer significantly richer semantic information than is available in current databases like COMLEX and WordNet, by characterizing the conceptual frames within which words are defined and identifying the semantic roles which the arguments of these words can take.   These roles and frames are key to building domain-independent language understanding applications.    The project will focus from the start on specific NLU applications:    word sense disambiguation, information extraction, multilingual information extraction, and an eventual extension to text data mining.    For each application, the PI and his team will apply the FrameNet++ system to improve the domain independence of the semantic components, using statistical algorithms for semantic annotation that we have already begun to implement.    These applications will in turn provide a rich and realistic evaluation framework to guide FrameNet++ development, and will encourage potential users to apply it to a wide variety of tasks.<br/><br/>The FrameNet++ database will be capable of serving many purposes.    Provided with statistical information about frequencies of words, word/sense mappings, and combinatorial patterns linked to word senses, it will be usable in various automatic language understanding processes, including word sense disambiguation and information extraction.    Since the formal semantic annotations are keyed to conceptual structures which are independent of any individual language, they are available for the creation of parallel lexicon databases of other languages.    The semantic structures in the databases will facilitate matches from one language to another, in machine translation and machine-assisted translation, while the syntactic structures allow the production of appropriate grammatical sentences in the target language.<br/>"

More recently, explicit social recommender systems have emerged, which can be categorized as social-matching (i.e., recommending individuals to each other either online or face-to-face) or social-interaction-space matching (recommending various social venues such as club meetings, political events, or online chat rooms). Researchers have begun to lay clear intellectual foundations for the exploration of the former, but not the latter. In fact only a handful of these systems have been deployed and none has used real-time models or hybrid recommendations of physical or virtual spaces.<br/><br/>The proposed project will examine the utility of various social-interaction-space recommendation system designs through rapid prototyping and evaluation in both the field and laboratory. This core components model will be achieved through an exploration of the character of chat-channel recommendations for large complex online (AustNet IRC network) and physical (NJIT campus) spaces. The ultimate goal is to build and sustain community that will result in the development of design guidelines and a theoretical framework that will inform system developers and HCI/CSCW researchers.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Using computer technology to improve people's navigation of their social environment so that they can easily coordinate with others in activities of interest is a simple way to improve social connectivity and social capital. This is an important concern, as individuals embedded in richly connected social environments are better able to handle personal setbacks such as financial failures and illness, provide social support for others, and advance their career. Local communities and neighborhoods that have high levels of social interaction are more likely to engage in collective action, and support economic development. Systems that increase such interactions are therefore of enormous social value. This SGER will enable the exploration of a largely untested way to improve social navigation, namely deploying synchronous (near real time) social-interaction-space (chat rooms, meeting rooms, clubrooms, lecture halls, etc.) recommender systems. The project will also benefit the research community through the release of usage data from the field trials (in a suitably sanitized form) and open source software applications. Finally, the novel profiling matching algorithms and privacy mechanisms developed for this class of systems, and understanding of determinants of use of such systems, will be applicable in the government and business sectors, as well as in academia."

These application domains require systems of tremendous complexity, as also indicated by the fact that a large part of our brains, with a processing capacity orders of magnitude larger than any technical system, is devoted to vision and control of behavior. It is doubtful whether systems of the required complexity can be designed by current computing methodologies. It is proceeded with the realization that radically new design principles will have to be developed, and are seeing this project as part of a broader effort to establish the new computing paradigm Organic Computing (OC). OC aspires to understand and emulate information processing in living systems, a form of information processing that does not seem to follow traditional algorithmic control, but rather mechanisms of evolution, adaptation, goal-oriented self-organization and learning.<br/>The study will perform towards this goal by a series of theoretical and experimental studies that will demonstrate the principles of OC and how it can replace traditional programming in classical problems of computer vision and robotic control. <br/>On the intellectual side, the project will contribute considerably to robust large-scale intelligent and autonomous systems in the future, and a better scientific understanding of the functional principles that are at the basis of autonomous vision, motor control, and visual-motor coordination, also with a view towards interdisciplinary exchange with the neuroscience. The broader impact will be to profoundly transform the style in which large software systems are developed and to open computer systems to the direct creative influence of the non-technical user. The significance of our particular sample applications will be progress with advanced sensing, perception and actuation systems in unstructured environments, as a basis for HCI systems and also for the emerging field of neuro-prosthetics and rehabilitation engineering as well as robotics and autonomous vehicle control.<br/><br/><br/>"

The new National Science Standard (1995) demand that  students know not only the facts but also how to reason  scientifically. The growing infusion of information technologies  into the home and work place demands that students know not only  how to access and retrieve information on the Internet, but also  how to use it discriminantly in their learning. Technologically  competent students know not only the facts but also how to express  their knowledge and ideas with these tools. These are challenging  tasks for schools and teachers which need to be addressed beginning  at an early age when students' attitudes about science and  technology are still open and project-based activities are easier  to integrate into the curriculum.    The proposed research addresses these challenges by developing an  integrative year-long curriculum consisting of a rich fabric of  instructional techniques materials, and technology use in  elementary school science.  Learning Science by Design builds on  young students' informal science knowledge and asks them to  program, i.e., design, interactive multimedia resources to teach  science concepts in either physics (magnetism/electricity) or life  sciences (ocean habitats) to younger students. Students'  programming process provides the driving force for their science  investigations, Internet information searching, and design of  instructional interventions. This approach uses proogramming as a  tool for students' knowledge reformulation and personal expression  by engaging them in key scientific practices: fostering information  inquiry, constructing representations and visualizations of  scientific processes, explaining and defending ideas, and managing  of  their projects.    Two questions will be addressed in the proposed research: (1) What  is the efficacy of such a comprehensive learning environment for  y oung students? (2) What kind of skill and  knowledge transfer can  we observe? Research will be conducted in several public elementary  classrooms in implementing the year-long curriculum that comprises  two distinct design experiences, thus facilitating the assessment  of transfer of programming, project and information management  skills, and science knowledge. The evaluation is divided into three  phases: Phase I builds the model case and assessment tools, Phase  II conducts the experimental and comparative assessment, and Phase  III examines the applicability of the model to different school  sites and classrooms.    The principles that I am developing in my research will also be  directly applied to my teaching activities. My teaching plan  emphasizes the integration of education and information studies and  will create a set of courses that provide both graduate and  undergraduate students with an introduction and experience of the  new information and learning media, their theoretical  underpinnings, and meaningful applications in formal and informal  educational settings.    The findings of the proposed research will be disseminated to  resarchers and to teachers. I anticipate that the approach provides  a model for implementations of advanced technologies in elementary  school classrooms, also applicable to other grades and school  levels. Furthermore, the proposed integration of information and  education fields will lead to an improved understanding of  educational theory and practice and the disign of future learning  and information technologies.  ***"

This is particularly true in the Arctic stratosphere where the loss of ozone is not as severe as in the Antarctic. The microphysics of the nucleation, growth, composition, sedimentation of particles in polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) is one of the critical areas for understanding Arctic ozone loss. PSC particles provide sites for the heterogeneous chemistry required to activate chlorine, which then destroys ozone. The pivotal role played by PSC particles is most evident in the Arctic when ozone loss is essentially modulated by temperature, a surrogate for PSCs, from year to year. The frequency, duration, and timing of PSC occurrence determines to a large extent the amount of ozone loss. Removing some of the present uncertainties concerning PSC formation temperatures, particle composition, and particle phase will permit more careful modeling of the amount of chlorine processed by PSCs. This project is to collaborate on joint measurements of PSC characteristics during the Third European Stratospheric Experiment on Ozone. The instruments will be flown onto one balloon gondola which will simultaneously measure, in situ, aerosol concentration, size, composition, depolarization, backscattering, and gas phase concentrations of nitric acid and water. The investigation will focus on methods to infer particle index of refraction, which is a function of composition. These joint measurements will be the first direct measurements of the complete thermodynamic environment in which PSC particles exist, coincident with a characterization of aerosol size, concentration, composition, phase, and optical properties. These measurements should reveal the extent to which the measured PSCs are in thermodynamic equilibrium with their environment, which hydrates of HNO3 are formed, and the abundance of condensed HCI, an important species for chlorine activation."

The methodology combines ideas from game design, computer science, information visualization, New Media Art and media theory. The project will combine two research efforts: The Scalable City developed in the Experimental Game Lab directed by Professor Sheldon Brown, and Cultural Analytics developed by the Software Studies Initiative directed by Dr. Lev Manovich. The Scalable City is an interactive artwork that uses custom computer graphics software to create a dynamically changing 3D urban environment. First, satellite imagery of real cities is manipulated through image processing routines to generate new, highly patterned terrains. After spatial analysis, areas are ""zoned"" for development using a variety of eccentric ""real estate development"" schemes - space filling curves, dense grids, mazes, and combinations of these forms. As a critical artwork, the Scalable City has been designed to challenge the existing conventions of 3D narrative environments. It engages the users in a narrative of discovery, not that of a story line, but of interacting with the world in self-reflective ways.   Cultural Analytics is a computational method to quantitatively analyze patterns and rhythms in visual media such as photography, design, film, animation, choreography, and music composition. It has been developed specifically for humanities scholars of visual culture and media studies to harness the powers of computational methods to identify patterns of creativity. <br/><br/>Using the Cultural Analytics framework, Brown and Manovich propose to develop a new methodology for the analysis of users? activities and visual experiences in a multi-user version of the Scalable City. The Cultural Analytics Framework will be embedded into the Scalable City generative software. This new analytical software layer will enable the transformation of the virtual world in real-time in response to patterns in users? behavior and visual experience.  At the same time, by incorporating the new analytics techniques in virtual world generation software, the project aims to advance the current research on how to create interfaces and simulations which analyze user performance and dynamically adapt based on the results of the analysis If successful, this research is likely to have transformative effects in a number of fields. Game designers, HCI researchers, and games and media scholars will be able to analyze, visualize and interpret the dimensions of user experiences with interactive time-based cultural artifacts such as video games, animated interfaces, and interactive artworks which are not captured with current analytics techniques such as network analysis (connectivity, load, and latency), econometrics on virtual economies, and profiling player game play."

But as we move towards a world where interaction is based on human body movement that are not well documented or studied, we risk creating technology and systems that may lead to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs).  This is not a hypothetical but a real danger.  In the past devices such as keyboards have led to MSDs, yet many new systems make no effort to avoid gestures that are known to lead to musculoskeletal disorders or to eliminate gestures that are symptomatic of a patient population.  With multi-touch interfaces currently being considered for adoption by companies and academia, it is now more critical than ever that good design practices incorporating preventive approaches be implemented in the initial stages of product design and development.  In this research, the PI and his interdisciplinary team that includes experts in human-computer interaction, kinesiology and ergonomics will evaluate the effect of multi-touch interaction on the musculoskeletal system and provide mechanisms for developing safe multi-touch systems that involve interactions designed to cause minimal musculoskeletal stress and risk.  Project outcomes will include best practices and standards for interaction that are safe yet allow users to fully benefit from the new levels of immersion that multi-touch interaction affords.  In particular, the PI will develop a toolkit that will allow multi-touch designers to input a gesture movement and evaluate its induced stress in a variety of situations and under different variables.  In addition, the software will allow input of formal definitions of HCI tasks and some choices of gestures, and will suggest a set of suitable gestures for the task based on the given choices.  To achieve these goals, the PI will explore new formal models of human-computer interaction that take multi-touch interaction into account at both the cognitive and psychomotor levels.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This research will provide multi-touch interaction researchers with valuable new models and tools that focus not on a particular application area but rather on the generic technique of multi-touch interaction and design.  The new biomechanical models will also contribute to our fundamental understanding of the functioning of our hands.  Project outcomes will be generalizable to other emerging types of input devices, such as the Nintendo Wii remote."

Consider a statement such as: ""Hey, that's John striding across the quad, I'd recognize his bold confident walk anywhere!"" Every human being has his/her own unique perceivable movement style-repeated recognizable movement elements that can be notated-which a Laban movement analyst would call a ""movement signature."" These elements in their combinations and phrasing capture the liveliness of a person's movement-his or her dynamic expressiveness. Despite advances in the motion capture process, many important subtleties still get diminished or lost. If applied to computer animation, current motion capture results lack the original dynamic life-quality; the person's movement signature is not preserved, and the animations look rather artificial and robotic. So it is unlikely that John would look like himself in an animation done using current motion capture techniques. The PI will collaborate with artists and scientists that are movement specialists, to study current motion capture shortcomings and to develop LMA filters that explicitly capture perceptually important features and amplify them as necessary to achieve more expressive animations. To this end, the PI plans to exploit new factorization-based capture techniques, and new representations of dynamics that are estimated from example LMA data. The PI will also develop new motion retargeting techniques to transfer and modify the measured dynamic LMA features to other character models. . The PI will apply his techniques to medical analysis and rehabilitation, gesture recognition, and archiving and annotation of movement databases.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project will lead to a better understanding of human movement analysis, and to better computer tools that can be used for human movement in applications related to HCI, medicine, psychology, education, entertainment and the arts."

The term ""human computer interaction"" suggests a two-way exchange, with each participant aware of the other and responding appropriately. In reality, computers may appear frequently rude, frustrating, indifferent, and generally unpleasant. Much of this can be attributed to the fact that current computers are almost completely unaware of the actual state of the human user. The research community has proposed methods for computers to understand and respond to the user's feelings with mixed results. Emphasis has been placed on stress and frustration, feelings often generated by the use of the computer itself. There is no previous work, however, with regard to monitoring the actual health of the user during computer use. In this project, the PIs will incorporate physiologic monitoring in the human-computer interface, with the help of a thermal imaging camera employed as a computer peripheral. Through bio-heat modeling of facial imagery, they will monitor a range of vital signs including blood flow and cardiac pulse. This physiological information will then be used to draw inferences about a variety of health symptoms, possibly including stress, headaches, and heartbeat irregularities. Outcomes of the project will include novel/improved facial tracking and bio-heat modeling algorithms that: will allow contact-free and accurate measurement of vital signs without restricting the user; will enable the study of ubiquitous ailments like stress, heartbeat irregularities, and headaches on an unprecedented continuous basis; and will serve as a catalyst for the creation of new HCI paradigms that incorporate the computer as an aware and responsive partner with the user (e.g., in which the computer can react in real time to physiologic data for the benefit of the user). <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: In the short term, the results of this project will provide less cumbersome tools for those attempting to conduct research in the areas of usability and of emotional and affective interfaces. In the longer term, they will support a fundamental change in the way that we interact with machines. Today, software designers create systems that they hope will not frustrate the users. In the future, software designers will create truly collaborative interactions in which human and machines are both observing and responding. This has the potential to greatly improve the usability of systems for the elderly, minorities, the economically disadvantaged, and other populations impacted by the ""digital divide."" On the clinical front, developing systems that can monitor the health status of an individual will revolutionize remote monitoring and the care of chronic conditions such as anxiety, heartbeat irregularities, and headaches."

This project embodies a novel approach to Anywhere Augmentation based on efficient human input for wearable computing and augmented reality (AR), through both sketch-based interfaces on hand-held devices and direct-overlay 3D user interfaces. Mobile augmented reality is a powerful interface for wearable computing. If computer users are enabled to place arbitrary annotations in 3D space wherever they go, the physical world becomes the user interface. Instead of embedding computing and display equipment in the environment as in the case of ubiquitous computing, graphical annotations are overlaid on top of the environment by means of optical see-through glasses or video overlay. Robust registration between the physical world and the augmentations is necessary. Current approaches rely on the availability of a 3D model of the environment or on its instrumentation with active or passive markers. The PI's approach is novel in that he proposes to emphasize, support, and utilize the expertise of the human in the loop to make Anywhere Augmentation feasible. Human users generally have a clear grasp of the layout of the scene in front of them, and they can easily identify the physical objects with which information should be linked. The PI plans to enable users to transfer their intuitional scene understanding to the computer through intelligently constrained and assisted user interfaces. Current real-time computer vision techniques and algorithms, while far from being able to facilitate automatic scene understanding, are very well suited to constrain and guide a user?s informed input for scene analysis and augmentation, delivered in the form of a few simple point selections, stroke gestures, and common classifications. As a main source of input, the PI will employ video feeds from small head-worn or palm-top-device cameras. The devices, algorithms and interaction techniques will be applicable to novel settings and application scenarios (e.g., visualization of occluded infrastructure, navigational guidance, and social and educational applications for high-school students).<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The PI will use this research as a case study and platform for projects supporting the teaching of human-computer interaction fundamentals. As a first step towards actively furthering the inclusion of minority students in the benefits of the research, the PI has partnered with Jackson State University, MS, and will also collaborate with outreach programs supporting local underrepresented K-12 students, where he will enhance the after-school programs and field trips with carefully planned AR experimentation and mentoring. The goal of Anywhere Augmentation will be tested by making research products (new devices, tools, and interfaces) available to students and field scientists in a wide variety of environments (e.g., as a campus navigation and inventory tool, for an emergency response scenario, at UCSB lab open houses, and at international conferences). The PI will also introduce innovations in three courses in the curriculum of the UCSB Computer Science Department (an undergraduate elective on HCI which he established, the undergraduate senior CS design project course cycle, and a new graduate course on 3D user interfaces), so they include hands-on experiences on effective UI design and programming for mobile devices, including mobile AR interfaces. To this end, the PI will also involve the UCSB Allosphere, a 3-story spherical surround-view 3D immersive space, as a mobile AR simulator."

However, passwords are either difficult to use (if they are long and randomly generated), or insecure (if users are given the choice of their own passwords). Password Managers are one promising approach aimed to improve the usability and security of passwords, by having a computing device, rather than the user herself, store (and optionally, generate) passwords, and then later deliver or recall them to the user whenever access is needed. A number of password management schemes have been proposed and are employed currently by many affected users. <br/><br/>This project concentrates on password management using mobile devices (e.g., cell phones), whose ubiquity makes them an appealing authentication aid. It embarks upon two research directions vis-a-vis such phone managers. First, the project aims at a systematic and formal evaluation, via usability studies and surveys, of currently deployed phone managers. Second, it proposes a redesign that exploits the many different capabilities and characteristics of modern phones (such as on-board sensors and computational resources), in order to address several of the drawbacks with current phone managers. Specifically, a general-purpose password management approach -- called proxy-based authentication -- is introduced. As the name suggests, this approach uses the phone as an authentication proxy between the user and the device to be authenticated to. The project explores how proxy-based authentication can be used to strongly authenticate to: (1) critical online services -- that continue using passwords or PINs -- without incorporating any service-specific modifications, (2) local devices (such as desktops, laptops, ATMs), and (3) ubiquitous but constrained devices (such as personal RFID tags) for user-controlled privacy and enhanced security.<br/><br/>The technical merit of this project lies in two aspects. First, it will arrive at a better understanding of current phone managers in terms of usability, efficiency, and security. The goal is to gain insights into users' mental models when using these password managers. Second, the project will pursue the realization of usable proxy-based authentication primitives. To this end, this work is able to simply reuse wealth of existing research on usable user-phone authentication. Instead, the main thrust is on exploring the design and evaluation of usable authentication methods between the phone and the service that ultimately requires authentication. In particular, for phone-service authentication, the project investigates novel short-range human-perceptible (HP) communication that is commonly and cheaply available, fast, robust, least intrusive, and low-power. Notably, the research investigates how to use HP communication to create authenticated channels, and authenticated and eavesdropping resilient channels. Based on the principle of extrinsically motivated design, the project also explores playful HP channels. These channels make the task of manual transmission a fun and entertaining activity for the users.<br/><br/>The anticipated impacts of the project include: (1) enhanced interaction among several disciplines including security and cryptography, computer and electrical engineering, networking, and usability and HCI; (2) increased awareness among students and users regarding security practices vis-a-vis one of the most important security problems (authentication); (3) integration of PI's research with educational activities, enabling students taking part in the project to acquire currently uncommon skills at the cusp of Human-Computer Interaction and Trustworthy Computing; (4) emphasis on technology transfer by working with manufacturers and industrial consortia. Another long-term impact of this work is the development of security technologies that can eventually be put to use by general population, i.e., are usable in the true sense. Furthermore, the work is expected to be instrumental in stimulating research on usable security technologies for the blind or visually impaired users who are usually at a high risk for various security vulnerabilities and attacks, perhaps more so in the context of authentication."

Yet this community of scholars, which includes faculty in diverse fields such as social informatics, social computing, CSCW, computational social science, HCI, and information science, remains fractured and largely invisible.<br/><br/>The CSST series of Summer Institutes is a critical step toward unifying this diverse community and enhancing its visibility, by providing an immersive experience for the next generation of SST leaders (both advanced doctoral students and pre-tenure faculty) so that they will be well prepared to engage in distributed scientific inquiry. The Summer Institutes build critical intellectual and social capital by fostering creation of a cohort group of new researchers whose work is shaped by hearing experts in socio-technical systems research provide encouragement and give advice on how to advance the field's intellectual basis, methodological approaches, and potential for sustained, meaningful and even transformative impact. <br/><br/>The 2012 workshop will adhere to the successful format that has evolved and been refined over the course of the prior Summer Institutes. The workshop will bring together early career researchers selected through a competitive review process with a set of more senior researchers for an intensive five-day research exchange. The event will be residential and located in a semi-isolated locale to encourage the maximum amount of social interaction among participants. Senior faculty, junior faculty, and advanced doctoral students will collectively strive to articulate in more coherent and contemporary forms the basic principles, goals and approaches to doing socio-technical science across a range of relevant intellectual communities. They will explore topics and methods for advancing the science of socio-technical systems, while focusing on intellectual development of individual research that is aligned with core aspects of the socio-technical perspective. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The diversity of Summer Institute participants across a number of dimensions (e.g., institutional, disciplinary, geographic, gender, minority group status), serves to broaden participants' perspectives at a critical stage in their careers. The immersive intellectual experience during the workshop will facilitate creation of a social network among the participants and the senior researchers who serve as instructors for the Summer Institute. This network will play a major role both in the professional development of the participants and in the evolution of the field of socio-technical systems research."

Stress is defined here as sympathetic arousal, an ever-present mechanism that helps humans cope with perceived threats or challenges. The planned experiments, in which criticality and computer-mediation define the two axes of the experimental space, will cover a rich set of combinations that include bi-weekly exams each of which counts for a small percentage of the grade vs. midterm and final exams that each count for a large percentage of the grade, alternately offered in paper and iPad forms. Subjects will be randomly divided into control and interventional groups; in the interventional group the time will be relaxed, to determine the effect of stress reduction on the evolution of competency. Unobtrusive measurements (to ensure non-interference with the observed behaviors) will span the genetic, physiological and psychological levels, while micro to macro measurements will afford a deep understanding of the issues. While most HCI-related projects aim to change the design of the interface, this research instead investigates the possibility of ""changing"" the human (student) by revolutionizing relevant aspects of the educational system. Improving the human-computer interface is a secondary aim where, depending upon the success of the intervention, stress-reduction designs can be conceived to counter-balance the time stressor.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This research tries to identify and suggest ways to correct problems in paper- vs. computer-mediated exams, precipitated by strong sympathetic responses. To this end the PI explores the role of the time stressor, and in so doing questions certain aspects of the prevailing educational philosophy."

Chlorinated hydrocarbons comprise one of the most widespread, chemically long-lived classes of hazardous waste The compounds are denser than water and migrate downward through groundwater and vadose zones. It is often difficult to verify the effectiveness of subsurface remediation methods because remediation activities--such as soil washing and solvent extraction--may exacerbate the migration. Thus, improved methods are required to monitor concentrations of these compounds. Any new analysis technique must be field deployable, provide rapid (real time) response, and must be selective for chlorinated hydrocarbons in the presence of large backgrounds of inorganic chlorides. This will be a monitoring method that can provide continuous determination of changes in the local concentrations of the chlorinated solvents during remediation. The approach can be engineered for use with cone penetrometers or can be implemented in fixed locations including well headspace areas. Vapor including chlorinated organic compounds is sampled through a membrane used to exclude liquids, then is decomposed in an electric discharge. The concentration of discharge-produced HCI is measured by near-infrared diode laser spectroscopy. Fiber optics bring the laser light to the measurement region from a miniature diode laser that is kept above ground and that can be multiplexed among numerous measurement points. This approach guarantees rapid time response and low operating costs. Ppm detection limits for chlorinated hydrocarbons with a 1 second response time and a measurement dynamic range of 104 are anticipated. The proposed technology is designed to be compatible with cone penetrometry in order to take advantage of the market for remediation diagnostics that has already been created around the use of cone penetrometers. Chlorinated hydrocarbons account for 35 to 40% of contamination in soil and ground water at thousands of sites requiring remediation."

Today, people wear smart glasses, smart watches, and fitness devices and carry smartphones, tablets and laptops. In a decade, the very same people are likely to wear or carry tens of wireless devices and interact with the Internet and computing infrastructure in markedly different ways. Two fundamental challenges emerge in a post-smartphone era: dealing with the impending spectrum crunch before it becomes a full-fledged crisis, and, advancing human-computer interaction (HCI) before people buckle under the demands of dealing with an ever increasing number of personal devices. This project seeks to address these two challenges by proposing a first of its kind integrated networking and sensing environment based on visible light communication (VLC). The proposed research advances VLC research in two new directions: VLC networking and VLC sensing.<br/><br/>The project designs integrated VLC networking and sensing for smart spaces (iVLC) and a set of robust VLC networking and sensing algorithms. The VLC networking algorithms address the following challenges: 1) frequent connection disruptions caused by user mobility and the limited coverage of individual VLC links, 2) link interference from diffusive lights, and 3) determining the optimal placement and density of LED lights. Addressing these challenges requires efficient handoff schemes between adjacent LEDs, interference handling schemes for VLC networks, and optimization algorithms to determine the LED light deployment in smart spaces. The VLC sensing requires accurate inference of user gestures using shadows rendered on the floor. The combination of light from multiple light sources on the ceiling obfuscates and distorts these shadows. To tackle this challenge, the iVLC system separates shadow components by embedding identifiers into light signals from LEDs allowing light sensors on the floor to measure the light illuminance of individual light sources. Finally, a novel proof-of-concept iVLC testbed will be designed, built, and deployed, which comprises LEDs and light sensors. Results from the Bits in the Light Project will help accelerate the deployment of VLC as a new mobile networking and sensing technology."

Consequently, the design of low latency, high bandwidth, power-efficient and reliable Network-on-Chips (NoCs) is proving to be one of the most critical challenges to achieving the performance potential of future chips. While multicores are facilitating an enormous integration capacity, aggressive transistor scaling has also led to a steady degradation of the device and circuit reliability. Increased device wear-out (due to negative-bias temperature instability (NBTI), electro migration (EM) and hot carrier injection (HCI)) has exacerbated the waning reliability of transistors, thereby resulting in a significant increase in faults (both permanent and transient), and hardware failures. As faults manifest within the NoC substrate, multicore chips are faced with excessive delays and increased power consumption while recovering from the fault. While NoC reliability research has made significant strides at inter- and intra-router levels, there is still a lack of a holistic design approach covering the reliability of the entire NoC architecture, from device wear-out, to links and routers, to routing protocols, to applications in a cohesive manner.<br/><br/>This project will develop a holistic design methodology that addresses the reliability of the entire NoC communication infrastructure (device, links, routers, routing algorithms, and topology) while minimizing energy footprint, reducing the area overhead and only marginally impacting performance. To achieve our goal of improving link fault-recovery, this project will develop techniques to maximize the utilization of the inter-router links with minimum power and area overhead. For the router, this project will propose intra-router reliability techniques with the goals of maximizing hardware utilization, reducing redundancy and area overhead, and minimizing router pipeline latency. Further, wear-leveling techniques developed by this project will improve the reliability of NoCs and the lifetime of the chip. Finally, the proposed techniques will be evaluated by developing fault models that are injected into the NoC and evaluate the fault coverage, performance degradation and energy efficiency through extensive modeling and simulation. The holistic design methodology spanning the entire NoC architecture and the reliability techniques developed from this project will positively impact the next generation multi-core and System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures with improvements in energy efficiency, performance and robustness to hard faults and soft errors. This project will play a major role in education by integrating discovery with teaching and training, and by attracting and training minority students in this field."

In essence the projected infra-structure will allow us to investigate this future.<br/><br/>In a sense, technologically savvy users already construct ecologies for themselves in an ad hoc manner. We ensure that hand-held devices we carry will synchronize with our larger devices like laptops and desktops. We ensure data exchange among the various applications we use, and we create personal and group workflows among our computational environments. We keep appropriate adaptors so that our portable devices have access to the projection screens or group displays in our work environment. We learn the interaction that is needed on each platform to ensure cross-platform interactivity. Finally, we organize our work and life around these interoperations ? synching our iPods and iPads periodically, selecting applications on each platform to support the way we work and our lifestyle as a whole. The challenge of this proposal is to remove the ad hoc nature of the construction of such one-of-a-kind ecologies.<br/><br/>Our proposed infrastructure comprises two related subgroups. First, we propose a Rapid Prototyping Laboratory (RPL) where faculty and students can develop new devices to populate the ecologies. The RPL will support electronic and single-board-computer designs, printed-circuit board prototyping, and 3D object construction. Second, we will construct the larger environment to be populated by these devices.

Virtual reality environments rely on a collection of technologies that allow the user to go through a coherent and unified perceptual experience involving multiple senses, such as vision, touch, and sound, while interacting with 3-dimensional data. These immersive, highly visual, 3D environments currently offer a fairly high level of performance for spatially visualizing data. However, the corresponding machinery providing user interaction with these systems has not kept up the same pace of development with the visualization tools. At present some advanced commercial environments offer some user interaction capabilities achieved through wired wearable hardware (such as wired gloves and head mounted displays). This promotes, in turn, an unnatural and cumbersome interaction between the user and the virtual reality environments, curbing the acceptance of the technologies. The syntax and semantics of the hand and finger gestures developed interacts with geometric data, while the implementation relies on the Multi-Touch Surface computing platform as well as on a newly developed gesture tracking and recognition system. The environment should lead to a potent open platform for interacting with virtual geometric data in an intuitive way, without the need for wearable hardware galvanizing the state of the art at the institution in Nano and Design Engineering, Psychology, Computer Science, Structural biology, as well as support research in the Center for Health, Intervention, and Prevention (CHIP). This project addresses the problem.<br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>This instrumentation will be open source and widely available with well documented set up procedures. The VR system will be networked with other VR-sites, including VRAC at Iowa State, to maximize the impact and stimulate technology transfer. Moreover, the instrument contributes to<br/>- Stimulate critical avenues of interdisciplinary research involving engineering, biology, computer science,  <br/>psychology, and Human Computer Interaction (HCI),<br/>- Strengthen the potential for educational, student recruiting, and outreach activities, and<br/>- Perform targeted outreach to K-12 students, teachers, and school districts serving groups that have<br/> traditionally been underrepresented in the engineering disciplines. <br/>The project also advances the state of the art in the teaching and practice of engineering design, as well as other fields in which geometry plays and important role. Contributing to the development of a new generation of professionals that use capabilities of virtual reality tools to augment traditional disciplines for improved engineering design, this work should have a long-lasting impact on the ability of scientists and engineers."

More than 55 accomplished senior scholars and 210 promising junior investigators have participated in the previous seven CSST Summer Research Institutes  The diversity of participants across a number of dimensions (e.g., institutional, disciplinary, geographic, gender, minority group status), serves to broaden participants' perspectives at a critical stage in their careers.  The immersive intellectual experience during the workshop will facilitate creation of a social network among the participants and the senior researchers who serve as Institute instructors.  This network will play a major role both in the professional development of the participants and in the evolution of the field of socio-technical systems research."

To extend the reach of crowdsourcing, this project investigates interactive systems, platforms and computational techniques to integrate experts as core participants of crowdsourcing systems. The project will develop and evaluate three related systems that improve the coordination, participation and education of expert crowds. First, the project will develop modular, composable workflows to guide paid expert crowds to accomplish complex tasks such as design and engineering. A second system seeks to attract a new form of expert participation by reaching out to experts in their spare moments. A final system will enable crowd workers to learn new skills by leveraging existing tasks as work-study opportunities. This research will produce three concrete types of results: 1) techniques and patterns for guiding expert crowds and their contributions, 2) scientific results and evaluations that depict the strengths and weaknesses of expert crowds, and 3) open, public platforms and systems to recruit, guide, and train members of expert crowds.<br/><br/>Crowd work has the potential to employ millions of full-time workers and grant them the flexibility to guide their own careers. The proposed work advances a vision of how experts can engage in the future crowd-work economy, contribute to projects while improving their own skills, and be supported by practical knowledge and new sociotechnical systems. The project also includes a plan to use expert work-study techniques to provide realistic training in Stanford?s HCI curricula and develop a peer mentoring system to scale advising and informal learning."

Thus, the next generation of computational scientists must be capable of responsibly and effectively leveraging a spectrum of sensing data from data-generating humans. With this focus, the REU Site will expand its trajectory as an attractor for highly diverse students, including women or gender minorities and students with disabilities, who will gain experience with sensing hardware and software towards transformative advances in intelligent systems focused on human behaviors and cognitive processes. Enabling diverse stakeholders early in their careers to discover how to collect, fuse, make inference with, and visualize multimodal human data helps nurture a workforce that can transform how humans and machines engage and collaborate. The research in the REU Site will address two limitations in AI: first, that underserved populations are at risk of being marginalized with the present focus on big data AI and, second, that AI trainees often lack experience with human data collection and critical thinking about human-elicited datasets. The REU Site will stimulate novel, safe ways for systems to team up with people to address society's vexing problems while remaining fair, attuned to bias, and representative of the diverse fabric of the general population. <br/><br/>The REU Site in Computational Sensing for Human-centered Artificial Intelligence sets three ambitious and attainable goals and will publish widely on the findings at computational and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) research and education venues: (1) to advance basic research in computational sensing for human-centered AI, integrating human study with sound AI experimentation focused on modestly-sized, inclusive datasets; (2) to develop programmatic mechanisms for aiding students to transition confidently from being taught to being mentored by research faculty and ensure their readiness for entering computer science/STEM PhD programs; and (3) to enhance and intensify our recruiting strategies with the aim of doubling Native American or Latina/o students and students with disabilities among our applicant pool, as well as reach even more demanding selection targets for exceptionally diverse cohorts. We link these objectives to four associated Site aims: (a) to offer team-based research with real-world problems that emphasize social good and impact; (b) to cost-effectively enable global awareness and skills-building, by facilitating on-campus international cultural exchange for REU cohorts; (c) to provide outreach enrichment for cohorts to learn how to communicate research broadly; and (d) to disseminate lessons learned from the REU Site to the scientific community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the hope is that the use of algorithms will improve societal outcomes and economic efficiency, concerns have been raised that algorithmic systems might inherit human biases from historical data, perpetuate discrimination against already vulnerable populations, and generally fail to embody a given community's important values. Recent work on algorithmic fairness has characterized the manner in which unfairness can arise at different steps along the development pipeline, produced dozens of quantitative notions of fairness, and provided methods for enforcing these notions. However, there is a significant gap between the over-simplified algorithmic objectives and the complications of real-world decision-making contexts. This project aims to close the gap by explicitly accounting for the context-specific fairness principles of actual stakeholders, their acceptable fairness-utility trade-offs, and the cognitive strengths and limitations of human decision-makers throughout the development and deployment of the algorithmic system. <br/><br/>To meet these goals, this project enables close human-algorithm collaborations that combine innovative machine learning methods with approaches from human-computer interaction (HCI) for eliciting feedback and preferences from human experts and stakeholders. There are three main research activities that naturally correspond to three stages of a human-in-the-loop AI system. First, the project will develop novel fairness elicitation mechanisms that will allow stakeholders to effectively express their perceptions on fairness. To go beyond the traditional approach of statistical group fairness, the investigators will formulate new fairness measures for individual fairness based on elicited feedback. Secondly, the project will develop algorithms and mechanisms to manage the trade-offs between the new fairness measures developed in the first step, and multiple existing fairness and accuracy measures. Finally, the project will develop algorithms to detect and mitigate human operators' biases, and methods that rely on human feedback to correct and de-bias existing models during the deployment of the AI system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since the site's inception in 2006, students' commitment to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields has been demonstrated, as well as producing research publications. Students are provided with classroom training and gain hands-on experience using cutting-edge instruments, equipment, computers and cyberinfrastructure. Classes in computer programming and graphics, interface design, human-computer interaction, research skills, team skills, and ethics occupy approximately one third of the students' time. In an unusual structure that is focused on building a community of practice, students conduct interdisciplinary research projects in groups of two or three, with all students co-located in Iowa State's Virtual Reality Applications Center (VRAC). Each group interacts with VRAC graduate students under the supervision of VRAC faculty. The research projects are presented at an end-of-the summer campus-wide research symposium in the form of posters, demos, and a five-page research paper. Frequently the students present their research at research conferences later during the school year. <br/><br/>Two major trends are driving research in Emerging Interface Technologies (EIT): a dramatic increase of interface technologies themselves, and the ubiquitous permeation of technology into our everyday lives. Correspondingly, this research focuses on new interfaces that enhance people's perception, understanding of complexity, and work performance. The SPIRE exposes students to three broad areas of EIT: information visualization, virtual/augmented reality, human-agent interaction. In particular, previous projects have focused on improving cockpit sensor displays for pilots, the optimal use of emotional cues by intelligent agents during crisis situations in the International Space Station, use of virtual reality for improved drone navigation, use of augmented reality for reducing errors in factory assembly lines, reducing cyber sickness, improved user interfaces for faster traffic incident management, design tradeoffs of wearable biosensors and use of wireless electroencephalography (EEG) caps with people who have Parkinson's disease.

Consequently, the design of low latency, high bandwidth, power-efficient and reliable Network-on-Chips (NoCs) is proving to be one of the most critical challenges to achieving the performance potential of future chips. While multicores are facilitating an enormous integration capacity, aggressive transistor scaling has also led to a steady degradation of the device and circuit reliability. Increased device wear-out (due to negative-bias temperature instability (NBTI), electro migration (EM) and hot carrier injection (HCI)) has exacerbated the waning reliability of transistors, thereby resulting in a significant increase in faults (both permanent and transient), and hardware failures. As faults manifest within the NoC substrate, multicore chips are faced with excessive delays and increased power consumption while recovering from the fault. While NoC reliability research has made significant strides at inter- and intra-router levels, there is still a lack of a holistic design approach covering the reliability of the entire NoC architecture, from device wear-out, to links and routers, to routing protocols, to applications in a cohesive manner.<br/><br/>This project will develop a holistic design methodology that addresses the reliability of the entire NoC communication infrastructure (device, links, routers, routing algorithms, and topology) while minimizing energy footprint, reducing the area overhead and only marginally impacting performance. To achieve our goal of improving link fault-recovery, this project will develop techniques to maximize the utilization of the inter-router links with minimum power and area overhead. For the router, this project will propose intra-router reliability techniques with the goals of maximizing hardware utilization, reducing redundancy and area overhead, and minimizing router pipeline latency. Further, wear-leveling techniques developed by this project will improve the reliability of NoCs and the lifetime of the chip. Finally, the proposed techniques will be evaluated by developing fault models that are injected into the NoC and evaluate the fault coverage, performance degradation and energy efficiency through extensive modeling and simulation. The holistic design methodology spanning the entire NoC architecture and the reliability techniques developed from this project will positively impact the next generation multi-core and System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures with improvements in energy efficiency, performance and robustness to hard faults and soft errors. This project will play a major role in education by integrating discovery with teaching and training, and by attracting and training minority students in this field."

The event will take place in conjunction with and immediately preceding the 2015 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC), to be held October 18-22 in Atlanta, and sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society.   The primary goal of this year's VL/HCC Doctoral Consortium, the 13th to be funded by NSF in this series, is to stimulate graduate students' thinking about how to make computation easier to express, manipulate, and understand.  In particular, what methods, models and tools can people use to visualize, analyze, tailor, and direct socio-technical systems?  The doctoral consortium aims to stimulate novel approaches that go far beyond simplistic solutions like Web browsers and search engines.  Although search engines do provide information that is useful in simple situations, they represent only one portion of a socio-technical system (information retrieval); search engines alone are not powerful enough to be used to start new businesses and run them competitively, for example, since they only give people the ability to find resources provided by other people rather than the ability to create new resources.  Effective approaches will bring users and software together in creative and productive ways that bear directly on the needs of modern society.   The Doctoral Consortium will help shape ongoing and future research projects aimed at alleviating a pressing problem of relevance to a great many people within our society.  This event will promote discovery and learning, by encouraging the student researchers to explore a difficult and challenging open problem, through involvement of a panel of well-known researchers whose task is to provide constructive feedback, and through inclusion of other conference participants who will also learn from and provide additional feedback to the students and to each other.  The PI and the members of the organizing committee will make special efforts to attract a diverse and interdisciplinary group of student participants, with special attention paid to recruitment of students from underrepresented institutions and women; to further increase diversity, no more than 2 student participants (at least one of whom must be female) will be accepted from any one institution.<br/><br/>This year marks the 31st anniversary of the Symposium.  Established in 1984, VL/HCC's mission is to support the design, formalization, implementation and evaluation of computing systems that are easier for a broader group of people to learn, use, and understand.  This includes research aimed at visual technology and text, and technology that uses sound, taste, virtual reality, and the Web.  It also includes research on theories about the many media used toward this goal.  VL/HCC occupies a unique niche among HCI and programming language conferences, in that it focuses specifically on how to help end users successfully develop and use software.  Recent advances in computing have led to continually deeper integration between computers and human society.  People now swim in a ""sea"" of socio-technical systems that synthesize large numbers of contributing users with vast amounts of source code.  Examples include social media systems, open source repositories, online marketplaces and massively multiplayer online games.  Yet as the socio-technical systems in this sea have grown in complexity, they have become increasingly difficult for end users to understand and direct toward productive ends.  More information about the VL/HCC Symposium may be found online at https://sites.google.com/site/vlhcc2015/.  The workshop will build community among young researchers working on different aspects of these problems from the perspectives of diverse fields including computer science, the social sciences, and education.  It will guide the work of these new researchers by providing an opportunity for experts in the research field (as well as their peers) to give them advice, in that student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop and will receive feedback from a faculty panel.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether the results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  As in prior years the VL/HCC 2015 Doctoral Consortium will be part of the regular conference program.  A 2-page extended abstract of each participant's work will be published in the conference proceedings."

But as we move towards a world where interaction is based on human body movement that are not well documented or studied, we risk creating technology and systems that may lead to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs).  This is not a hypothetical but a real danger.  In the past devices such as keyboards have led to MSDs, yet many new systems make no effort to avoid gestures that are known to lead to musculoskeletal disorders or to eliminate gestures that are symptomatic of a patient population.  With multi-touch interfaces currently being considered for adoption by companies and academia, it is now more critical than ever that good design practices incorporating preventive approaches be implemented in the initial stages of product design and development.  In this research, the PI and his interdisciplinary team that includes experts in human-computer interaction, kinesiology and ergonomics will evaluate the effect of multi-touch interaction on the musculoskeletal system and provide mechanisms for developing safe multi-touch systems that involve interactions designed to cause minimal musculoskeletal stress and risk.  Project outcomes will include best practices and standards for interaction that are safe yet allow users to fully benefit from the new levels of immersion that multi-touch interaction affords.  In particular, the PI will develop a toolkit that will allow multi-touch designers to input a gesture movement and evaluate its induced stress in a variety of situations and under different variables.  In addition, the software will allow input of formal definitions of HCI tasks and some choices of gestures, and will suggest a set of suitable gestures for the task based on the given choices.  To achieve these goals, the PI will explore new formal models of human-computer interaction that take multi-touch interaction into account at both the cognitive and psychomotor levels.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This research will provide multi-touch interaction researchers with valuable new models and tools that focus not on a particular application area but rather on the generic technique of multi-touch interaction and design.  The new biomechanical models will also contribute to our fundamental understanding of the functioning of our hands.  Project outcomes will be generalizable to other emerging types of input devices, such as the Nintendo Wii remote."

The bi-annual Group conferences, sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery, are a leading forum for the presentation and discussion of organizational systems, information systems, social informatics, and computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) research and practice.  They are attended by approximately 120 CSCW, HCI, and allied Computer Science, Information Science, and Information Technology researchers and professionals, and the conference proceedings are heavily-refereed and widely cited.  The Doctoral Consortium at Group07 will take place on November 4, 2007, with a follow-up poster session to be held during the conference's technical program on November 6, and a wrap-up analysis and summary session for the doctoral consortium students on November 7.  This is a new doctoral consortium, but similar consortia have taken place at the CSCW conference since 1992 (the most recent of them sponsored in part by NSF), and have helped to launch the careers of many fine CSCW researchers.  The goals of the event are to build a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues, to guide the work of the new researchers by having the experts in the research field give advice, to provide encouragement and support for the selection of Group research topics, to make it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference, to illustrate the interrelationship and diversity of Group research, and to make the new entrants' experience at the Group conference an enjoyable and rewarding  one, thereby encouraging them to return in the future and submit papers, panels, demonstrations, posters, etc.  During the full day of the Consortium, each student will make a formal presentation about his/her doctoral research.  Feedback will be provided by each member of the faculty panel, as well as by the other student participants, and will help student participants understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, whether their results are being appropriately analyzed and presented, etc.  Students will have an opportunity to interact more informally with the faculty (and additional guests) during lunch and dinner on the Consortium day.  The poster session scheduled for the second day of the technical program will afford student participants a chance to present their work to conference attendees in general.  The organizers of the Consortium will make a special effort to attract participants from under-represented communities, and to reach beyond the traditional CSCW research community.  NSF funding will provide support for the domestic travel and lodging of the students, as well as the direct expenses of putting on the event.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The Group07 Doctoral Consortium will bring together the best of the next generation of organizational systems, information systems, social informatics, and computer supported cooperative work researchers. The event will allow them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers, and this will play a major role in their enculturation into the profession.  Since the students and faculty will constitute a diverse group along several dimensions, the students' horizons will be broadened at a critical stage in their professional development."

Humans are very good at discerning the spatial origin of sound using a mixture of frequency-dependent interaural time difference (ITD), interaural level difference (ILD), and pinna spectral cues in disparate environments ranging from open spaces to small crowded rooms.  This ability helps us to interact with others and the environment by sorting out individual sounds from a mixture, and helps us to survive by warning us of danger over a wider region of space compared to vision.   These advantages of spatial sound are important for human-computer interaction. <br/><br/>While the frequency-independent ITD cues (delays) associated with the two ears are relatively easy to render over headphones, the ILD (level difference) and pinna elevation cues are not.   For a given source location and frequency content, the sound scattered by the person's torso, head and pinnae, and is received differently at the two ears, leading to differences in the intensity and spectral features of the received sound.   These effects are encoded in an extremely individual ""Head Related Transfer Function"" (HRTF) that depends on the person's anatomical features (structure of the torso, head and pinnae).   This individuality has made it difficult to use the HRTF in the proposed applications.   Recent research, including that of members of this team, has focused on measuring the HRTFs for individuals in specific environments, on constructing models of the HRTF, on understanding how the geometry of the body is related to the characteristics of HRTF, and how the brain processes the cues to derive spatial information.   However, this research has also indicated that the brain is extraordinarily perceptive to errors in cues that result when sound is rendered with an incorrect HRTF.<br/><br/>In this project the PI and his team will use numerical methods to compute individualized HRTFs from accurate 3-D surface models of the body.   They will use multiview, multiframe computational vision techniques to extract the surface models from imagery.    They will then use boundary element methods employing fast multipole/ transform techniques and parallel processing to compute the HRTFs from the surface models.    The resulting HRTFs will be evaluated both by objective comparisons with acoustically measured HRTFs and by psychoacoustic testing, and will be used in demonstrations of virtual reality, augmented reality, and teleconferencing.   A major advantage of this vision-based approach is that it will allow the PI and his team to investigate and model the way that HRTFs change with body posture, providing the potential of tracking dynamic environments.     Thus, the project will include fundamental research to extend the static HRTF measurements to dynamic situations in different environments, using a combination of visual tracking to locate the person in real space, and construction of in-room HRTFs from free-field HRTFs using fast iterative techniques.    This will provide a scientific foundation for HCI applications of audio rendering.   The research will in addition yield algorithms and understanding that will have an impact on varied fields, including computer vision based model creation; scientific computing; computational acoustics for noise control and land mine detection; neurophysiological understanding of human audition; etc.<br/>"

The project will demonstrate how C3 forums can be transformed with a high-engagement visualization layer for cybersecurity talent recruitment. This project has a potential to increase student and researcher community engagement in cyber-challenge academic competitions. It will implement key innovations and lessons from e-Sports competitions as potential design alternatives for the visualization framework. By increasing the interest and impact of C3, it will help to identify and attract talented individuals. Elevating the experience of participants and spectators at C3 events has a potential to increase interest in the cybersecurity profession, promote cybersecurity to a larger talent pool, and decrease the age at which people become interested in this field. Currently, e-Sports events draw a broader following among minority groups than C3 events. The project aims to increase the appeal of C3 events to a younger and broader audience and to understand specific factors that inhibit female and minority student participation in fields related to cybersecurity.<br/><br/>The purpose of this project is to identify and develop critical cybersecurity skills. The engagement strategies and human-intuitive presentation methods employed in the current generation of C3 events seem to attract those who have already acquired an interest in cybersecurity. The proposed underlying 3D game-like visualization of network attack and defense systems may lead to operational enhancements to future threat-analysis environments. The project will primarily focus on human engagement and understanding of complex data presentation in fast-paced computer attack and defense competitions. The project's system design will incorporate perspectives and prior research from the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) research community, including abstraction, inclusive demographic and gender appeal, intuitive iconography, and visual-cognitive load management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The event will take place in conjunction with the 2013 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC), to be held September 15-19, 2013, in San Jose, California, and sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society.  The long-running VL/HCC series occupies a unique niche among HCI and Programming Language conferences, in that it focuses specifically on how to help end users successfully develop and use software.  Recent advances in computing have led to continually deeper integration between computers and human society.  People now swim in a ""sea"" of socio-technical systems that synthesize large numbers of contributing users with vast amounts of source code.  Examples include social media systems, open source repositories, online marketplaces and massively multiplayer online games.  Yet as the socio-technical systems in this sea have grown in complexity, they have become increasingly difficult for end users to understand and direct toward productive ends.  <br/><br/>The primary goal of this year's VL/HCC Doctoral Consortium, the eleventh to be funded by NSF in this series, is to stimulate graduate students' and other researchers' thinking about how to make computation easier to express, manipulate, and understand.  In particular, what methods, models and tools can people use to visualize, analyze, tailor, and direct socio-technical systems?  The doctoral consortium aims to stimulate novel approaches that go far beyond simplistic solutions like web browsers and search engines.  Although search engines do provide information that is useful in simple situations, they represent only one portion of a socio-technical system (information retrieval).  For example, search engines alone are not powerful enough to be used to start new businesses and run them competitively, since they only give people the ability to find resources provided by other people, rather than the ability to create new resources.  Effective approaches will bring users and software together in creative and productive ways that bear directly on the needs of modern society.  <br/><br/>The workshop will build community among young researchers working on different aspects of these problems from the perspectives of diverse fields including computer science, the social sciences, and education.  It will guide the work of these new researchers by providing an opportunity for experts in the research field (as well as their peers) to give them advice, in that student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop and will receive feedback from a faculty panel.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether the results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  As in prior years the VL/HCC 2013 Doctoral Consortium will be part of the regular conference program.  A 2-page extended abstract of each participant's work will be published in the conference proceedings.  More information about this year's VL/HCC conference may be found online at https://sites.google.com/site/vlhcc2013.  <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The workshop will help shape ongoing and future research projects aimed at alleviating a pressing problem of relevance to a great many people within our society.  This event will promote discovery and learning, by encouraging the student researchers to explore a difficult and challenging open problem, through involvement of a panel of well-known researchers whose task is to provide constructive feedback, and through inclusion of other conference participants who will also learn from and provide additional feedback to the students and to each other.  The PI and the members of the organizing committee will make special efforts to attract a diverse and interdisciplinary group of student participants, with special attention paid to recruitment of students from underrepresented institutions and women.  While most of the students supported by this award will come from U.S. universities, as in past years due to the highly international make-up of the research community a couple of non-U.S. students may be invited to participate as well.  To further increase diversity, no more than 2 student participants will be accepted from any one institution."

The project includes a workshop with researchers with relevant but diverse expertise to introduce the current protocol for data collection, and requests their recommendations for improvements. The proposed activity will improve the protocol to address the needs from the community. Affective computing is an important research area aiming to understand, analyze, recognize, and synthesize human emotions. Providing emotion capabilities to current speech-based interfaces can facilitate transformative applications in areas related to Human Computer Interaction (HCI), healthcare, security and defense, education and entertainment. The research infrastructure envisioned in this project will open new opportunities that we cannot address with current speech emotional databases. In the area of affective computing, the proposed corpus will provide suitable training sets to explore learning algorithms that are powerful, but require large amount of labeled data. It is expected that the size, naturalness, and speaker and recording variety in the proposed corpus will allow the community to create robust models that generalize across applications. Improvements on speech emotion recognition systems will facilitate the transition of these algorithms into practical applications, providing unique societal benefits. The proposed infrastructure will also play a key role on other speech processing tasks. For the first time, the community will have the infrastructure to address speaker verification and automatic speech recognition solutions against variations due to emotion.<br/><br/>The proposed infrastructure relies on a novel approach based on emotion retrieval along with crowdsource-based annotations to effectively build a large, naturalistic emotional database with balanced emotional content, reduced cost and reduced manual labor. The database considers podcast recordings that are available in audio-sharing websites. Although the approach of building affective databases using media content has been previously explored, the contribution of this study is the use of machine learning algorithms to retrieve audio clips with balanced emotional content, providing natural stimuli with wider spectrum of emotions. The proposed approach relies on automatic algorithms to post-process podcasts and a cost effective annotation process, which make it possible to build large scale speech emotional databases. This approach provides natural emotional renditions that are difficult to obtain with alternative data collection protocols. This project involves the research community from the design of the corpus, which is the key goal in this community infrastructure planning project. The community also play a key role in the selection of target sentences to be emotionally annotated, with novel grand challenges where the goal is to recognize and retrieve target emotional behaviors in unconstrained, unlabeled recordings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The long-running VL/HCC series occupies a unique niche among HCI and Programming Language conferences, in that it focuses specifically on how to help humans successfully develop and use software.  The diversity and ubiquity of people's goals, interactions, and concerns with information systems is continually increasing.  Not only does interactive computer software permeate many individuals' working lives, people commonly rely on computing and information systems for leisure and home activities as well.  As a result, end users now expect considerable flexibility and control in their interactions with computer software.  For many, it is no longer sufficient to consume the packaged software and scripted tasks developed by the professional software industry; they now must produce their own computational solutions to a wide variety of problems, including spreadsheet models, web sites, educational media and simulations, automated business procedures, and visualizations.  To produce such software, even for domain-specific problems, end users must look beyond surface-level interaction with computers and acquire the conceptual models and skills of computational thinking.  But current advances toward computational thinking by end users are not evenly distributed across all segments of the population.  Thus, this year's VL/HCC Doctoral Consortium, the seventh to be funded by NSF in this series, will focus on expanding the benefits of computational thinking to diverse populations.  Ensuring that designers of computational languages and tools consider the needs of populations historically overlooked in information technology will increase the chance that these individuals/groups are able to learn and use the more powerful tools that are fast becoming essential to information literacy.  At the same time, such efforts may lead researchers to identify new software construction metaphors and techniques that increase the usability of their languages and environments more generally.  The workshop's primary goal is to stimulate graduate students' and other researchers' thinking about how varying communication media, representations, and problem-solving support affect end users' willingness and ability to access, manipulate, and program solutions to their work or everyday problems.  What are the special needs of disadvantaged populations?  How can computational problem-solving tools and devices be designed to meet these needs?  The workshop will bring together and build community among young researchers working on different aspects of these problems from the perspectives of diverse fields including computer science, the social sciences, and education.

As an intellectual haven for about a million people, it demonstrates how the Internet can host large global learning communities. However, learning here has been primarily oriented toward individual learning. In this project the Math Forum now aims to bring together some of its visitors with similar interests to work on common issues: students exploring a math issue together, teachers developing curriculum, or technologists and educators designing interactive math applets and support tools. Collaborative learning in small workgroups can be particularly effective in motivating interest in math and in building and communicating deep understanding. A proliferation of small groups will heighten the sense of a vital community and increase its ability to become self-sustaining and vigorous. The groups will help people increase their community participation and their interest in mathematics. The Project will investigate these questions and related issues through a series of pilot studies, controlled experiments, prototypes and field studies using group-formation and group-scaffolding software that is designed, implemented and assessed in collaboration with an international, multidisciplinary group of leading HCI, CSCW and CSCL researchers. In particular, three different kinds of groups will be formed and supported: (a) groups of students who visit the site and work on a collaborative problem of the month, (b) groups of teachers, student teachers and mentors who develop new problems and curricular approaches, and (c) multidisciplinary groups of international researchers and developers who design and assess the technologies and interventions of the Project. An unfulfilled promise of the Internet is to bring together systematically people who do not live close by, but who could benefit from interacting within knowledge-rich contexts. This Project addresses core issues of computer support for collaborative learning (CSCL): how best to form and structure intimate learning workgroups within global knowledge-building communities and how to effectively scaffold their interactions.<br/><br/>The Math Forum model has substantial broader impact. The automated formation of small groups and support for interactions developing deep understanding of mathematics will be suggestive for virtual learning communities in other domains, taking advantage of other digital libraries. This model provides opportunities for students and teachers excluded from collaborative learning due to geographic isolation, disadvantaged schools, physical disability, discrimination and other physical or social factors. The model stimulates both student motivation and teacher development, transforming interest in mathematics from a social stigma into a bridge to global friendships. Additionally, the Project builds on the PI's prior work on a EU grant. Core aspects of the Project including technology design, pedagogy and assessment will be conducted by workgroups of American and European leaders of the CSCL community in collaboration with Project staff. Annual week-long intensive workshops will bring these collaborators together with each other and with teachers and Project staff.<br/><br/>"

Yet relatively little attention has been paid to the graphics that appear in text documents, although they are an important resource and often convey information that is absent from any accompanying text.  In this project the PI will develop a methodology for automatically summarizing informational (non-pictorial) graphics, such as bar charts and line graphs, that convey attributes of entities and relationships among the entities.  Although some informational graphics are only intended to display data, the majority of them that appear in newspapers, magazines, and formal reports are intended to convey a message.  This message captures the graphic's overall content and can serve as a summary of the graphic for storage, indexing, and retrieval.  The underlying hypothesis of the project is that information graphics contain communicative signals that can be utilized to identify the message that the graphic conveys.  These signals include the relative effort required for different perceptual tasks (since the easiest tasks are the ones a viewer will naturally perform and that will contribute the most to the message conveyed by the graphic), design choices such as graphic type, coloring, annotations, an exploded wedge in a pie chart, etc. (all of which may be used to draw attention to certain entities and relations in the graphic), and elements of the graphic's caption (although captions are of limited utility due to their generally ill-formed nature).  The evidence about the graphic's message provided by the communicative signals will be entered into a Bayesian network that will attempt to deduce the graphic's message.  As part of the research, a large corpus of information graphics will be collected and annotated with their identified messages, in order to compute the probability tables required by the Bayesian network.  Evaluation experiments will be conducted to assess the system's ability to identify the message of an information graphic and the effectiveness of the message as a summary of the graphic.  In addition to simple bar charts and line graphs, the project will investigate the summarization of complex graphics such as grouped charts and composite graphs consisting of several interrelated graphics.  Although the project is only investigating the summarization of informational graphics, the PI expects the general approach and methodology developed here will provide insights into summarization methods for other kinds of graphics as well.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The project will create technology that enables access to informational graphics in a digital library and thereby empowers individuals to better utilize the wealth of information available in graphical form.  In addition, the outcomes of this research will include resources for use by others in the HCI community (e.g., the corpus of collected and annotated informational graphics will be made available to the research community).  The research will also contribute to the training of future scientists, by providing interdisciplinary thesis topics that overlap computer science and cognitive science."

At that point, individual, programmable processors will be like registers were to early VLSI design - building blocks within a larger organizing framework.  The investigators refer to this class of devices as Programmable Heterogeneous Multiprocessors (PHMs), emphasizing that not only will individual processors on the chip be programmable, but collections of processors on the chip as well as the chip as a whole must be considered programmable. Applications that might appear on such devices include that of current cell phones, current personal digital assistant (PDA) applications, global positioning system (GPS) sensing, Bluetooth, motion sensing, ad hoc networking, 3-D image processing,<br/>compression/decompression, security, multimedia and a broad set of human computer interaction<br/>(HCI) software. Ubiquitous and pervasive computing will produce newer scenarios with even more complex functionality. But these possibilities are limited by the ability to design and technically realize these scenarios in the individual space and power-constrained computing devices.  <br/>The class of single-chip computing that will leave the desktop in meeting the needs of future computing poses distinctly different programming and design challenges from board and network-level heterogeneous multiprocessors because a single chip is a finite resource, the hardware design will be semi-custom, and coordination of system resources will be required. All of these speak to levels of optimization that will be required for consumer electronic devices because of their physical limitations.<br/><br/>The project will investigate new design strategies that leverage the next level of design that is enabled as system performance can be evaluated with reduced modeling detail. The approach will define novel views of the proposed functionality and multiprocessor architecture, enabling simulation and optimization of the whole system's performance. Novel, proposed strategies include the development of design scenarios, which are the answer to the currently separate views of testbenches that exercise computer systems and benchmarks that are used to evaluate programmable designs, and the enabling of novel system-level strategies to save power by using a larger number of simpler processors that execute at lower clock rates or with sophisticated multiprocessor-level scheduling strategies. While ambitious, the project's vision is<br/>enabled because of prior work in developing a novel simulator that capture the performance interactions of concurrent software executing on concurrent hardware using a layered model.<br/>"

How relaxed am I right now? Will I feel better or worse tomorrow?""  These questions are increasingly answerable with personal data collected through fitness trackers and other sensors. Many of the tools that enable this kind of self knowledge rely on visualizations of the data to help users make sense of it. Choices made in the design of these visualizations typically focus on how data are displayed, which data are given priority, and how different types of data will be compared. All of these decisions impact how self-knowledge is created and supported by personal data tools. For populations with complex social identities (such as people experiencing serious mental illness or members of marginalized communities), visual conventions applied to personal data often carry problematic assumptions regarding what is ""normal"" and what ""progress"" looks like.  For example, common data science techniques for visually representing data such as statistical smoothing, normative baselines, and continuous temporal models often do not match well with the lived day-to-day experiences of people with mood or cognitive disorders who self-track as a form of therapy. This project will develop design methods and recommendations for personal data visualizations that better match unique needs of people's identities.  The work will also result in non-discriminatory data visualization practices, teaching materials, and professional resources for more reflective approaches to the design of personal data visualizations. <br/><br/>This research and related educational activities will focus on the visual encoding of personal data for populations particularly vulnerable to discriminatory and biased technology. Empirical design research will engage two vulnerable groups: 1) transgender and gender nonconforming young adults, who are at risk for mental illness and whose identities often badly match common gender assumptions in personal informatics systems and 2) autistic young adults, for whom social activities and visualizations may be quite different from neurotypical individuals. A series of grounded design inquiries will provide HCI, visualization, and data science communities with: 1) evidence of how non-expert data practices are formed through interacting with visualizations; 2) participatory design activities and collaborative visual elicitation protocols; 3) analysis of opportunities, impacts, and implications of non-discriminatory visual encodings of personal data; and 4) development and assessment of medium-fidelity prototypes for personal informatics systems for vulnerable populations. Educational activities will train data science students in human-centered design methods to provide future data scientists with tools to mitigate discriminatory design practices as they enter the workforce. Educational assessment will focus on impacts of these methods to prepare students to advocate against biases and make responsible decisions when working with data of vulnerable stakeholders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

People now swim in an ""ocean"" of socio-technical systems that synthesize large numbers of contributing users with vast amounts of source code.  Examples include social media systems, open source repositories, online marketplaces and massively multiplayer online games.  Yet as the socio-technical systems in this sea have grown in complexity, they have become increasingly difficult for end users to understand and direct toward productive ends.  The primary goal of this year's VL/HCC Graduate Consortium, the 17th to be funded by NSF in this series, is to stimulate graduate students' thinking about how to use tools and techniques in the early stages of problem solving such as problem definition and solution searching.  In particular, what methods, models, diagrams, and tools can people leverage to create mental models of complex socio-technical systems that can be used to make design decisions and for collaboration?  Effective approaches will bring users and software together in creative and productive ways that bear directly on the needs of modern society.   The Graduate Consortium will help shape ongoing and future research projects aimed at alleviating a pressing problem of relevance to a great many people within our society.  The student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop and will receive constructive feedback from the faculty participants as well as from the other students.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether the results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  This event will therefore promote discovery and learning, while also building community among young researchers working from the perspectives of diverse fields including computer science, the social sciences, and education.  To get feedback from a broader slice of the VL/HCC community, every student participant will present a poster or demo at the Showpieces event during the main conference. A 2-page extended abstract of each student participant's work will be published in the conference proceedings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is primarily based on benchmarking the Visual Analytics Challenge 2010 (organized through the IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology ? known as VAST- symposium contest/challenge) as a test bed to generalize user-centered evaluation to assess the effectiveness of interactive systems that combine analytical reasoning, visual representations, Human Computer Interactions (HCI), complex algorithms, and collaboration tools.  At present, there are no standard methods for measuring the performance of interactive visual analytics systems as a whole.  Visual analysis systems are not well suited for traditional evaluation methods.  For example, simple methods such as precision and recall are not suitable and researchers rarely have had sufficient access to historical data sets with the complexity of the analytical problems that exist across wider, real-time domains.  The means of approach to executing this project encompasses three activities: 1) gathering diverse collation of datasets with associated ground truth/problem descriptions, 2) developing automatic metrics and subjective evaluation criteria to assess judgment, and 3) the investigation of the effectiveness and utility of these methods and lessons learned for re-use in other dynamic fields such as business, intelligence, medicine, emergency response, etc."

HCOMP is the premier venue for disseminating the latest research findings on crowdsourcing and human computation.  While artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) represent traditional mainstays of this cross-disciplinary conference, HCOMP believes strongly in inviting, fostering, and promoting broad, interdisciplinary research.  More information about the conference is available online at http://www.humancomputation.com/2018/.  The Doctoral Consortium will be a research-focused full-day meeting immediately following the conference technical program on July 8.  It will enhance the scientific workforce in this emerging research area by nurturing a group of promising young investigators interested in human computation and crowdsourcing, allowing them: to attend the conference; to learn of potential career paths within academia and industry; to access an international network of researchers who can support their professional development; and to see firsthand the interdisciplinary nature, diversity and interrelationships of research in human computation.  The faculty mentors also will serve as the review committee for student applications. The organizers will promote diversity by selecting no more than one or two students from any one school, and by prioritizing the selection of women and underrepresented minorities.  <br/><br/>The full-day Doctoral Consortium will include activities to guide the research of these promising young researchers. The Consortium will allow participants to interact with established researchers and with other students, through presentations, question-answer sessions, panel discussions, and invited presentations. Each participant will give a short presentation on their research and will receive feedback from at least one faculty mentor and from fellow students. The feedback will be geared toward helping the student participants understand and articulate how their research is positioned relative to other work on human computation and crowdsourcing.  Activities led by the faculty will include a panel discussion to give students more information about the process and lessons of research and life in academia and industry. To further integrate the Doctoral Consortium participants into the conference itself, students will have a chance to present their work in an interactive poster session, and their papers will be posted online on the workshop webpage. These activities will benefit the participants by offering each fresh perspectives and comments on their work from researchers outside their own institution, both from faculty and other students; providing a supportive setting for mutual feedback on participants' current research and guidance on future research directions; and enabling participants to form a cohort of new researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Students' personal transformations since 2006 have been a dramatic and consistent result alongside research publications. Students are provided with classroom training and gain hands-on experience using cutting-edge instruments, equipment, computers and cyberinfrastructure. Classes in computer programming and graphics, interface design, human-computer interaction, research skills, team skills, and ethics occupy approximately 35% of the students' time. In an unusual structure that is focused on building a community of practice, students conduct interdisciplinary research projects in groups of two or three, with all students co-located in the Virtual Reality Applications Center (VRAC). Each group interacts with VRAC graduate students under the supervision of VRAC faculty. The research projects are presented at an end-of-the summer campus-wide research symposium in the form of posters, demos, and a five-page research paper. Frequently the students present their research at research conferences later during the school year. <br/><br/>Two major trends are driving research in Emerging Interface Technologies: a dramatic increase of interface technologies themselves, and the ubiquitous permeation of technology into our everyday lives. Correspondingly, this research focuses on new interfaces that enhance people's perception, understanding, and performance. The SPIRE exposes students to four broad areas of EIT: information visualization, mobile/ubiquitous interfaces, intelligent agents, and enabling cyberinfrastructure.

With support by ACM (especially SIG Multimedia), IEEE CS (especially its TC on Multimedia), and AACE (especially through ED-MEDIA), CRIM curriculum guidelines will be published to facilitate the spread of new multimedia specializations, courses, and training programs, as well as small ""knowledge modules"" (that will fit into existing courses, e.g., graphics, HCI, operating systems, networking).    This project also will contribute a new methodology for preparing curricular resources in high technology fields. First, it will draw upon prior curriculum and courseware developed at Virginia Tech (VT) and The George Washington University (GW) that will serve as a strawman for future work. Second, it will couple an in-person decision support room workshop with other interested parties connected through satellite and networked videoconferencing, so a first (semester long) round of collaborative work can proceed along the lines of agreed upon curriculum development directions. Third, during that round, not only will VT and GW materials be re-worked, but small travel awards to other consortium members also will lead to broader preparation of knowledge modules that can be easily disseminated and re-used. Efforts will be monitored by the project coordination team, to ensure progress in accord with project guidelines. Server logs will provide quantitative data on adoption and use that will supplement qualitative evaluation through surveys and focus groups. Fourth, during the next academic term (semester), completed modules  will be tried at sites other than where development took place, and carefully evaluated, at the same time as other new modules are built. Finally, this three-step pipeline of curriculum resource development, deployment, and evaluation will be institutionalized through the CRIM Consortium and its support by professional societies, so that periodic discussions, panels and workshops at multimedia conferences can further improve CRIM materials."

At that point, individual, programmable processors will be like registers were to early VLSI design - building blocks within a larger organizing framework.  The investigators refer to this class of devices as Programmable Heterogeneous Multiprocessors (PHMs), emphasizing that not only will individual processors on the chip be programmable, but collections of processors on the chip as well as the chip as a whole must be considered programmable. Applications that might appear on such devices include that of current cell phones, current personal digital assistant (PDA) applications, global positioning system (GPS) sensing, Bluetooth, motion sensing, ad hoc networking, 3-D image processing,<br/>compression/decompression, security, multimedia and a broad set of human computer interaction<br/>(HCI) software. Ubiquitous and pervasive computing will produce newer scenarios with even more complex functionality. But these possibilities are limited by the ability to design and technically realize these scenarios in the individual space and power-constrained computing devices.  <br/>The class of single-chip computing that will leave the desktop in meeting the needs of future computing poses distinctly different programming and design challenges from board and network-level heterogeneous multiprocessors because a single chip is a finite resource, the hardware design will be semi-custom, and coordination of system resources will be required. All of these speak to levels of optimization that will be required for consumer electronic devices because of their physical limitations.<br/><br/>The project will investigate new design strategies that leverage the next level of design that is enabled as system performance can be evaluated with reduced modeling detail. The approach will define novel views of the proposed functionality and multiprocessor architecture, enabling simulation and optimization of the whole system's performance. Novel, proposed strategies include the development of design scenarios, which are the answer to the currently separate views of testbenches that exercise computer systems and benchmarks that are used to evaluate programmable designs, and the enabling of novel system-level strategies to save power by using a larger number of simpler processors that execute at lower clock rates or with sophisticated multiprocessor-level scheduling strategies. While ambitious, the project's vision is<br/>enabled because of prior work in developing a novel simulator that capture the performance interactions of concurrent software executing on concurrent hardware using a layered model.<br/>"

We envision the day when such technology envelops society, and in concert empower individuals to function more effectively both individually and as members of society. In essence the projected infra-structure will allow us to investigate this future.<br/><br/>In a sense, technologically savvy users already construct ecologies for themselves in an ad hoc manner. We ensure that hand-held devices we carry will synchronize with our larger devices like laptops and desktops. We ensure data exchange among the various applications we use, and we create personal and group workflows among our computational environments. We keep appropriate adaptors so that our portable devices have access to the projection screens or group displays in our work environment. We learn the interaction that is needed on each platform to ensure cross-platform interactivity. Finally, we organize our work and life around these interoperations ? synching our iPods and iPads periodically, selecting applications on each platform to support the way we work and our lifestyle as a whole. The challenge of this proposal is to remove the ad hoc nature of the construction of such one-of-a-kind ecologies.<br/><br/>Our proposed infrastructure comprises two related subgroups. First, we propose a Rapid Prototyping Laboratory (RPL) where faculty and students can develop new devices to populate the ecologies. The RPL will support electronic and single-board-computer designs, printed-circuit board prototyping, and 3D object construction. Second, we will construct the larger environment to be populated by these devices. This environment includes a variety of large to personal display technologies and a set of tracking technologies to enable devices to situate themselves in space.<br/><br/>We have assembled two sets of research projects that benefit from this infrastructure. First we inves-tigate how our envisioned ecologies may be realized. We will study how this myriad of technologies may interoperate to give the user a set of consistent expectations of interaction across devices and display environments. We shall also investigate HCI methodologies for humans to function within the 3D world populated by devices and displays. Our second set of projects investigates various uses of our envi-sioned ecologies. Extending the ecology analogy, each use scenario furnishes a habitat that contextual-izes the ecologies within it. We advance a set of research areas: education and learning; universal access; insight formation; smart homes; usable security; mediated social interaction; and electronic-textiles to furnish such contexts where technology-interoperation and user-interaction may be explored.<br/><br/>An important aspect of this project is to encourage a kind of computational thinking among our re-searchers and students that span the digital and physical environment. As such our proposed infrastruc-ture will facilitate a broad interdisciplinary research. We will be using the infrastructure in the classes we teach bringing graduate students, undergraduates, and individuals from underrepresented populations into our research programs."

When we speak, our heads, eyes, bodies, arms, hands, and face are brought into the service of communication.  There is substantial evidence that communication does not exist for us separately from its embodied roots.  The cognitive and perceptual resources of attention (both visual and conceptual), working memory, long-term memory, temporal sequencing, language processes, touch, internal physiological experience, and proprioception must be considered together to understand the range of meanings a behavior has to the actor and receiver in a situation.  The PI recently submitted a proposal entitled ""CRI: Interfaces for the Embodied Mind"" by means of which he was able to secure funds for the acquisition of equipment necessary to exploring ideas such as those outlined above, but not for the exciting applications he envisages in collaboration with partner institutions.  The supplemental funding provided by this SGER will enable the PI to explore the implications of embodied interaction technology to communication in the domain of the liberal arts, specifically through participant and travel funding to support collaborative projects: (a) with Prof. Cassandra Newby-Alexander and others in Norfolk State University's Department of History who are investigating the Underground Railroad network in the four large urban slave centers of Norfolk, Portsmouth, Richmond, and Petersburg; and (b) with Prof. Pinckney Benedict of Hollins University's English Department on a pilot project in which two or more creative writing students develop an embodied adaptation of James Joyce's classic short story ""Araby"" which is rich in concrete environmental cues and written in a dreamlike narrative style that lends itself gracefully to nonlinear storytelling.  Each project will involve two faculty and two student members from the partner organization, along with students and faculty from Virginia Tech.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  Norfolk State University is an HBCU, and Hollins is a women's university.  This project will afford an opportunity to these partner institutions for their students and faculty to participate in the broader federally-funded research enterprise, and will at the same time expose students at Virginia Tech to students with diverse backgrounds and perspectives that will improve their ability to engage realistic HCI problems.  To these ends the PI will develop a collaborative research outreach model based on cross-institutional faculty teams.  He will define research projects that span multiple institutions and provide a scaffold for outreach partner institution students to work with their professors during the summers on the Virginia Tech campus.   Partner institution students will continue their research upon returning to their home institution, thereby transferring their experiences to home faculty and students while keeping their connection with the faculty and students they befriended over the summer.  Electronic communications and periodic cross-visits by the faculty team will keep the research vital.  An annual workshop at Virginia Tech will expose partner institution students and faculty to the broader research and stimulate greater synergy."

These emerging interaction styles, that are often referred to as Reality-based Interfaces (RBIs), leverage users' developmental abilities such as naive physics, spatial, social and motor skills, and offer concrete ways to think about abstract phenomena. Building on this work and motivated by the need of our nation to further engage children in STEM, this research investigates how to design age-appropriate reality-based interfaces that engage young children in scientific investigations, bio-design, and engineering. The project entails the development of novel human-computer interfaces that encourage children to explore and design within the domain of biological engineering, while facilitating learning of abstract concepts in a concrete way. This approach intends to promote a re-examination of the early childhood STEM curriculum to include emerging and interdisciplinary topics.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The project scope includes the design, implementation, and evaluation of RBIs for young children that support collaborative exploration of biological engineering. The research questions investigated focus on how reality-based interaction techniques can be applied to make the invisible tangible. Specifically, how to design novel interaction techniques that bridge the time and size scales of biology? How to design and implement interfaces that supports collaboration within both pairs and larger groups by integrating computational devices of different scales? How to support seamless transition between macroscopic and microscopic levels of information and across multiple devices? And finally, can RBIs allow young children to grasp abstract concepts that were previously considered too complex for their age and developmental stage? The outcomes of this project contribute to four areas of research: 1) tangible and embodied interaction, 2) computer supported collaborative learning, 3) interaction design for children, and 4) early childhood education in STEM."

This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Symposium.  Established in 1984, VL/HCC's mission is to support the design, formalization, implementation and evaluation of computing systems that are easier for a broader group of people to learn, use, and understand.  This includes research aimed at visual technology and text, and technology that uses sound, taste, virtual reality, and the Web.  It also includes research on theories about the many media used toward this goal.  VL/HCC occupies a unique niche among HCI and programming language conferences, in that it focuses specifically on how to help end users successfully develop and use software.  Recent advances in computing have led to continually deeper integration between computers and human society.  People now swim in a ""sea"" of socio-technical systems that synthesize large numbers of contributing users with vast amounts of source code.  Examples include social media systems, open source repositories, online marketplaces and massively multiplayer online games.

More information about the VL/HCC Symposium may be found online at https://sites.google.com/site/vlhcc2014. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this year's VL/HCC Doctoral Consortium, the twelfth to be funded by NSF in this series, is to stimulate graduate students' thinking about how to make computation easier to express, manipulate, and understand.  In particular, what methods, models and tools can people use to visualize, analyze, tailor, and direct socio-technical systems?  The doctoral consortium aims to stimulate novel approaches that go far beyond simplistic solutions like Web browsers and search engines.  Although search engines do provide information that is useful in simple situations, they represent only one portion of a socio-technical system (information retrieval); search engines alone are not powerful enough to be used to start new businesses and run them competitively, for example, since they only give people the ability to find resources provided by other people rather than the ability to create new resources.  Effective approaches will bring users and software together in creative and productive ways that bear directly on the needs of modern society.  <br/><br/>The workshop will build community among young researchers working on different aspects of these problems from the perspectives of diverse fields including computer science, the social sciences, and education.  It will guide the work of these new researchers by providing an opportunity for experts in the research field (as well as their peers) to give them advice, in that student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop and will receive feedback from a faculty panel.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether the results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  As in prior years the VL/HCC 2014 Doctoral Consortium will be part of the regular conference program.  A 2-page extended abstract of each participant's work will be published in the conference proceedings.  <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The workshop will help shape ongoing and future research projects aimed at alleviating a pressing problem of relevance to a great many people within our society.  This event will promote discovery and learning, by encouraging the student researchers to explore a difficult and challenging open problem, through involvement of a panel of well-known researchers whose task is to provide constructive feedback, and through inclusion of other conference participants who will also learn from and provide additional feedback to the students and to each other.  The PI and the members of the organizing committee will make special efforts to attract a diverse and interdisciplinary group of student participants, with special attention paid to recruitment of students from underrepresented institutions and women; to further increase diversity, no more than 2 student participants (one of whom must be female if two are accepted) will be accepted from any one institution."

Examples include social media systems, open source repositories, online marketplaces and massively multiplayer online games.  Yet as the socio-technical systems in this sea have grown in complexity, they have become increasingly difficult for end users to understand and direct toward productive ends.  Thus, when users put data into a system they may be unable to anticipate and control how their data will be used by other people or by software in the system; when users take actions in the system they often cannot foresee and manage unintended effects on other users, software, or the system as a whole, particularly because the system's software often contains defects. These problems are further complicated by the fact that different users simultaneously might take actions toward differing goals, while autonomous software such as agents might meanwhile also take actions toward goals of their own.  These and similar problems reflect a fundamental lack of sufficient methods, models and tools to help end users visualize, analyze, tailor, and manage large socio-technical systems.  At a deeper level, insufficient theory is available for predicting the complicated, unstable, sometimes-emergent behavior that results when large numbers of diverse, unpredictable humans are coupled to unreliable software.<br/><br/>This year's VL/HCC Doctoral Consortium, the ninth to be funded by NSF in this series, will focus on advancing knowledge and understanding of solutions to these problems.  The workshop will bring together and build community among young researchers working on different aspects of these problems from the perspectives of diverse fields including computer science, the social sciences, and education.  It will guide the work of these new researchers by providing an opportunity for experts in the research field (as well as their peers) to give them advice, in that student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop and will receive feedback from a faculty panel.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether the results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  As in prior years the VL/HCC 2011 Doctoral Consortium will be part of the regular conference program.  A 2-page extended abstract of each participant's work will be published in the conference proceedings.  More information about the VL/HCC conference may be found at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~vlhcc2011. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The workshop will help shape ongoing and future research projects aimed at alleviating a pressing problem of relevance to a great many people within our society. This event will promote discovery and learning, by encouraging the student researchers to explore a difficult and challenging open problem, through involvement of a panel of well-known researchers whose task is to provide constructive feedback, and through inclusion of other conference participants who will also learn from and provide additional feedback to the students and to each other.  The PI and the members of the organizing committee will make special efforts to attract a diverse and interdisciplinary group of student participants, with special attention paid to recruitment of women and minorities. The PI expects that most of the students supported by this award will come from U.S. universities but as in past years, due to the highly international make-up of the research community, a few non-U.S. students may be invited to participate as well."

The full-day event will take place on September 4, in conjunction with and immediately preceding the 2016 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC), to be held September 5-8 in Cambridge, UK, and sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society.  This year marks the 32nd anniversary of the Symposium.  Established in 1984, VL/HCC's mission is to support the design, formalization, implementation and evaluation of computing systems that are easier for a broader group of people to learn, use, and understand.  This includes research aimed at visual technology and text, and technology that uses sound, taste, virtual reality, and the Web.  It also includes research on theories about the many media used toward this goal.  VL/HCC occupies a unique niche among HCI and programming language conferences, in that it focuses specifically on how to help end users successfully develop and use software.  More information about the Symposium may be found online at https://sites.google.com/site/vlhcc2016/.  VL/HCC will be collocated this year with PPIG (Psychology of Programming Interest Group), which was established in 1987 in order to bring together people from diverse communities to explore common interests in the psychological aspects of programming and in the computational aspects of psychology.  Students who attend the VL/HCC Graduate Consortium will also have the opportunity to attend PPIG talks and interact with PPIG participants.  The PI and the members of the organizing committee will make special efforts to attract a diverse and interdisciplinary group of student participants, with special attention paid to recruitment of students from underrepresented institutions and women; to further increase diversity, no more than two student participants will be accepted from a given institution (and if two, then at least one of them must be from an under-represented group in STEM fields).<br/><br/>Recent advances in computing have led to continually deeper integration between computers and human society.  People now swim in a ""sea"" of socio-technical systems that synthesize large numbers of contributing users with vast amounts of source code.  Examples include social media systems, open source repositories, online marketplaces and massively multiplayer online games.  Yet as the socio-technical systems in this sea have grown in complexity, they have become increasingly difficult for end users to understand and direct toward productive ends.  The primary goal of this year's VL/HCC Doctoral Consortium, the 14th to be funded by NSF in this series, is to stimulate graduate students' thinking about how to use tools and techniques in the early stages of problem solving such as problem definition and solution searching.  In particular, what methods, models, diagrams, and tools can people leverage to create mental models of complex socio-technical systems that can be used to make design decisions and for collaboration?  Effective approaches will bring users and software together in creative and productive ways that bear directly on the needs of modern society.   The Doctoral Consortium will help shape ongoing and future research projects aimed at alleviating a pressing problem of relevance to a great many people within our society.  This event will promote discovery and learning, by encouraging the student researchers to explore a difficult and challenging open problem, through involvement of a panel of well-known researchers whose task is to provide constructive feedback, and through inclusion of other conference participants who will also learn from and provide additional feedback to the students and to each other.

A central aspect of and reason for scientific collaboration is creativity but we do not yet have a clear understanding of the relationship between collaboration and creativity in science. <br/><br/>This project will contribute to the basic science of creativity and to the empirical science of measuring creativity. Studies and theories of creativity in human computer interaction (HCI) contexts, and more specifically in real-world CSCW contexts, will advance this traditional area in psychology, which has tended to focus on static, and often unrealistic task situations. Second, this project will develop reusable metrics and measures of creativity in distributed scientific collaboration.<br/><br/>The Next Generation CiteSeer collaboratory (supported under a concurrent NSF Computing Research Infrastructure grant 0454052) will be used to identify and generalize requirements to support creative scientific collaboration in the context of distributed settings; develop and validate a multi-faceted framework to evaluate creativity as an embedded and long-term activity; codify and abstract critical incidents and breakdowns that occur during the longitudinal process of creativity.<br/><br/>Broader impacts<br/>The goal of this project is to enhance the quality of creative collaborative interactions in the Next Generation CiteSeer collaboratory. Two obvious trends in the research practices of the CISE community are its use of Internet-based collaboration (primary through email) and its use of digital resources, such as the ACM Digital Library. The Next Generation CiteSeer project brings these two trends together in a collaboratory environment for CiteSeer-based collaboration. This project will help to enhance our understanding of how this infrastructure can facilitate creativity; findings that may transfer well to similar efforts. <br/><br/>CiteSeer has been a valuable research tool for the CISE community. Log analysis of CiteSeer usage shows that it is well used by Hispanic Serving Institutions and by Historically Black Colleges and Universities.

Furthermore, bringing together these students in close contact with key CSCW researchers, both during the workshop itself and during conference poster presentations, will support the development of interdisciplinary dialogs, creating an environment for exchange and conversation that will further enable progress on the projects in the DC. There are short and long-term benefits from this work. In the short term, we will provide significant feedback to the specific students participating in the DC and more general feedback that can spread amongst other student attendees of the conference. In the long-term, we expect that students who have participated in the DC will then give back to the community by engaging as mentors to undergraduate students, and in the future to doctoral students.

Yet we still lack appropriate tools and methods for the design and development of applications that take advantage of these capabilities, hampering our ability to realize the technology's potential. When working with ""context-aware"" systems -- i.e., systems that sense and respond to the situations in which they are used, such as the user's current location, concurrent activities, or social setting -- it can be especially challenging to evaluate early-stage prototypes due to the difficulty of re-creating the anticipated context of use during development time. As a result, designers are forced to invest excessive effort into building robust, deployable prototypes early in the development process, resulting in premature commitment to inadequately explored design choices and an inability to apply best practices for user-centered design. <br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER project is to improve user-centered software development practices for context-aware applications by providing support for the systematic capture and reuse of contextual data throughout the development process. While previous efforts to support context-aware development have sought to make it easier to take prototypes into the field for testing, this approach seeks to ""bring the field into the lab"" by providing continuously available representations of an application's anticipated context of use. Such representations can be used for exploring and validating design alternatives with as little effort as possible. <br/><br/>The PI's RePlay system provides baseline support for the capture and playback of sensor traces representing an application's context, and will be extended through this research to include support for the capture and use of large sensor trace datasets; rapid, parallel prototyping of both interactive and infrastructure components of context-aware systems; and the ability to re-create complex contextual conditions during controlled user tests to an extent not currently possible. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: The PI's educational mission is to prepare rising HCI professionals for the constantly changing world of technology they will face throughout their career. As part of this project, he will develop teachable methods for integrating data capture, context representation, and novel forms of user testing into software design and development practice. These methods will be incorporated into existing design and evaluation courses at the graduate and undergraduate levels. Broader impacts will be obtained by sharing course materials, along with the tools described above, with educators and practitioners via the web. The PI also plans to present tutorials and workshops on the use of capture and playback tools during design at meetings and conferences hosted by professional design organizations."

For over 25 years, the bi-annual GROUP conferences have been a leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of research and practice on organizational behavior, information systems, social informatics, human-computer interaction (HCI), and computer supported cooperative work (CSCW), providing a showcase for innovative work on the development, introduction, management, deployment, and analysis of computer-based collaborative systems.  Research reports published in the GROUP conference proceedings are rigorously reviewed and widely cited.  More information is available online at http://oldwww.acm.org/conferences/group/conferences/group16/.  The GROUP conferences represent a critical link between the research communities supported by CISE/IIS and the broader social, behavioral, and management sciences.  Maintaining and fostering research dialog among these diverse disciplines will result in synergistic and transformative research collaborations, and developing young researchers who can effectively bridge two or more of the broader CISE/IIS, social and management sciences is an important goal to ensure the future vitality of the IIS research community.  In addition, there are both short and long-term benefits to the GROUP research community and to society from organizing this workshop.  In the short term, the doctoral consortium will bring together the best of the next generation of researchers in organizational systems, information systems, social informatics, and CSCW, and provide significant scholarly critique and career advice for them.  This will allow the students to create a social network both among themselves and with several senior researchers, and will facilitate their enculturation into the field.  Furthermore, in this tight fiscal environment and job market, the workshop will also provide an avenue for advanced PhD students to advertise themselves and their work to conference attendees, many of whom may be hiring in the near future.  Finally, the organizers will make every effort to ensure the recruitment of student participants who are diverse in terms of gender, under-represented minority status, and institutional affiliation; with respect to the latter, no more than two student participants will be accepted from any one institution, and if this is the case then at least one of them will be a woman.  This diversity will help broaden the students' horizons at a critical stage in their professional development.  In the long-term, students who have participated in the doctoral consortium will give back to the community by engaging as mentors themselves to future generations of students; the organizers expect these exceptional students to become the future leaders of the GROUP community.<br/><br/>The GROUP 2016 Doctoral Consortium will begin with a full day pre-conference research-focused workshop on Sunday, November 13.  The student participants will be later stage doctoral students from both the United States and abroad, and will represent a variety of disciplines including computer and information science, information systems, and communications.  Workshop activities will alternate between formal sessions (large group and breakout groups) and informal sessions (meals and breaks). In the large group sessions, Consortium participants will explore themes of general concern, including how to conduct high impact research, how to select and use different research methods.  Each student will present a summary of their work for public critique and lead discussion with currently open questions.  This is expected to help students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are being appropriately analyzed and presented.  During informal sessions students will have an opportunity to interact one-on-one with faculty and fellow students, which is important for network development.  The working lunch will focus on managing one's committee and learning how to ""finish well.""  The working dinner will focus on career development plans, including best strategies for the job search in academe and industry.  In addition to the day-long workshop, the program will also include events integrated throughout the conference such as student presentations at the posters/demos reception and a reflective wrap-up session.  The goals of the workshop are to build a cohort group of young researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread across the world, to guide and shape the work of the new researchers by having experts serve as mentors and give advice, to provide encouragement and support for the selection of GROUP research topics, to make it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend a leading research conference and to illustrate for them the interrelationship and diversity of GROUP research, and in general to make the new entrants' experience at the GROUP conference enjoyable and rewarding, so that they will be encouraged to return and submit to future conferences in the series."

This domain will provide a path to profitability, familiarize consumers with multi-object interfaces and allow the Siftables technology time to mature before other market opportunities are pursued.  If successful, this system will allow the company to advance the state of the art of distributed operating systems and sensor networks."

The research will focus on improving user interaction with speech recognition systems.  Previously, the PI developed a novel error specification technique that uses confidence scores to facilitate the recognition error correction process.  While earlier efforts by others to use confidence scores for this purpose had largely been unsuccessful, the PI's initial evaluation of his technique has yielded promising results; whereas earlier efforts relied on identifying specific words that were incorrect, the PI's technique can prove beneficial even if it is only possible to identify the regions where errors may exist.  In the new project, the PI will integrate confidence scores with techniques from natural language processing, to facilitate the process of correcting recognition errors.  He will develop novel interaction techniques and models, that support new interaction scenarios and allow for better understanding of the relationship between users and speech recognition systems.  Questions to be addressed include the following:  Can we expand existing models to effectively describe interactions between users and speech recognition systems when error correction activities are explicitly separated from dictation?  How can we support the process of finding and correcting recognition errors when these activities are temporally separated from dictation?  How do the abilities and limitations of individuals (e.g.,  traditional users and individuals with various disabilities) affect their strategies when completing tasks that involve deferred error correction?<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  This research extends an existing collaboration between UMBC's Information Systems Department and the Workforce and Technology Center  (WTC).  Speech recognition can be a critical technology for individuals with physical disabilities.  While these individuals have been shown to employ different strategies as compared to traditional computer users, limited research has focused on the use of speech recognition technologies by this important group of potential users. Therefore, by explicitly investigating the challenges these individuals encounter when using speech recognition technologies, this project will directly impact this underrepresented group of users, and will furthermore facilitate greater independence and new employment opportunities for them.  Because a broad range of users will be included in this project, the results will also benefit traditional computer users with no physical disabilities. Through the collaboration with the WTC, the PI will distribute his results via appropriate publications within the rehabilitation community, in addition to the HCI and ASR communities.<br/>"

The project is inspired by the ability of artists and designers to find analogies between diverse artifacts and bring them together to compose a coherent and novel narrative.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this research is the development of matching algorithms that suggest analogies across different media forms by looking at structural similarity within media content. The result will be a transformative technology at the intersection of art, computer graphics, machine learning, cognitive psychology, and human-computer interaction (HCI). Transderivational search will enhance the synaesthetic effect in analogy generation and will naturally lend itself to a wide range of brainstorming pursuits. Finding analogies between media of different forms (e.g., audio and 3D shapes) has not been explored, nor has there been much focus on non-literal search engines. Literal searches rely only on explicit meaning (e.g., the word ?three? and an image of the number 3) and categorization to determine similarity. Instead, this project will compare media samples by looking for structural similarity using analytical approaches such as statistical shape distributions, frequency analysis, and machine learning techniques to discover relationships between mixed- (multi-dimensional) media samples.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are in advancing artificial intelligence through transderivational search (essential to language and cognitive processing) and in opening up new research questions on search technology. The educational impacts are in drawing more women and minorities into CS and improving retention in CS programs by showing the relevance of search technology to creative design and to multimedia management. The transderivational search tools will be used by students in introductory level CS courses to build basic media management software. Transderivational search can also serve as a testbed for exploring algorithms in high level CS courses on machine learning, computer vision and graphics. <br/>"

But while studies have shown that tactual perception is the best modality for comprehension of graphical images by people who are visually impaired, the graphical images found in textbooks typically aren't available in this format.  Visually impaired students' lack of full access to the contents of textbooks impedes their learning, development, and success in MSE careers, areas in which individuals with disabilities are underrepresented.  This project seeks to address this problem, by developing innovative ways to overcome obstacles to the timely translation of graphical images into a tactual format.  The needs of two user communities will be addressed: transcribers who translate graphical images into tactual formats within low- and high-production environments; and students who are in MSE classes at the K-12 and postsecondary education levels, are blind, and read Braille.  To these ends, the PI has assembled an interdisciplinary team with expertise in image processing, machine learning, IR, HCI, experiment design, and addressing the needs of students with disabilities.  The PI and his team will design and develop the Tactile Graphics Assistant (TG Assistant), a set of plug-ins for Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, which will support transcribers in transforming, as automatically and intelligently as possible, graphical images into a high-quality tactual form that can be reproduced and then used by students who are blind.  Empirical studies will be conducted to better understand the perception of tactile graphics, and to inform the design of prediction models to estimate image comprehension time and comprehension accuracy, the application of machine learning techniques to classify images by their type, and the design of image processing algorithms to carry out the steps (appropriate for the image type) to translate an image into a tactual form.  A user-centered design approach will be followed during the development of the TG Assistant.  Project benefits will be documented by three proof-of-concept activities, wherein the TG Assistant will be used to provide access to textbook images to three students at the K-8, high school, and postsecondary education levels.  <br/><br/>Broader Impact. Tactual access to graphical images will improve blind students' learning, performance, retention, and potential to succeed in MSE careers.

Specifically, the research will explore how P3-Systems can strengthen community by helping individuals leverage location information to make new social ties and to coordinate better the interactions with colleagues, friends, and family to reinforce existing social ties. To achieve this goal, the project will work towards gaining an understanding of how to 1) capture and utilize geotemporal histories to identify social matches, 2) provide users with trustworthy face-to-face introduction tools and 3) provide geotemporally relevant introductions and social reminder alerts that do not overly interrupt the users or invade their privacy. Unfortunately, knowledge in regards to each of these key issues is lacking. We do not know how to effectively manage the capture of personal geotemporal histories from mobile networks of heterogeneous devices in order to compute social matches that take into account place types, recurring patterns of co-location, and place-linked roles. Nor do we have a basic understanding of how to effectively enable face-to-face introductions between users while simultaneously ensuring appropriate exchange and control of personal identity data. Important questions in regards to identity exchange to be examined include: In what order and at what rate should basic demographic details be transferred between users? How is the revelation of identity data affected by situational variables such as place, time and social company? How can the process be tied to social networks in terms of reputation and trust?<br/><br/>These key issues will be studied intensively using the New Jersey Institute of Technology's (NJIT) NSF supported SmartCampus location-aware community system test-bed. The SmartCampus test-bed will provide hundreds of students with heterogeneous wireless, locatable, lightweight, mobile, computing devices and deploy a variety of P3- Systems. A key SmartCampus P3-System that will be used to support this research is CampusMesh, a location-aware geotemporal social matching and reminding system. Multiple research methods will be employed, ranging from laboratory studies of how ""strangers"" engage in identity revelations, through usability studies of various software prototypes on different types of devices, through large scale field trials on the NJIT campus that will include user surveys and longitudinal monitoring of who-to-whom network traffic to identify changes in social networks. In the final year, field trials in one or more corporate locations will assess the generalizability of the findings. These studies of using P3-Systems to build and sustain community will directly result in: the development of design guidelines and theoretical frameworks that will inform system developers and HCI/CSCW researchers; empirical findings that will inform social scientists concerned with 'introductory communication' and the relationship between measurable affinities and the potential for growing social ties; and a variety of novel software applications.<br/><br/>This project will support several educational goals. First, the system developed will be field tested at NJIT, by the NJIT community. NJIT is a leader in minority education, and the city has a large minority population. Thus, the benefits of the technology to be developed will accrue to a population with fewer resources and more limited opportunities than the U.S. as a whole. Second, the project will provide excellent training and learning opportunities for numerous students through: courses in Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Supported Cooperative Work, Research Methods, Sensor Networks, and Pervasive Computing where students will work together in team projects that will either use CampusMesh and other SmartCampus applications or be directly involved in its research and development. Research assistants will participate in research using leading-edge technology, where they will learn a diverse set of empirical research methods. Finally, the research outlined will result in the creation of a technology rich, friendly, and welcoming campus experience for the NJIT student population.<br/><br/>In the early 20th century, people often came together face-to-face to make new acquaintances and to form voluntary associations such as social clubs, professional societies, and religious institutions that supported civil society. In subsequent decades the frequency of individual participation in these traditional associations and face-to-face meetings has declined along with associated measures of local social ties and social capital. P3-Systems offer one path to developing geographically concentrated social capital by enhancing community cohesion and by helping people to meet each other and coordinate their actions. To the extent that this research leads to effective, usable and trustworthy P3-Systems, it moves us closer to realizing this potential. The project will also benefit the research community through the release of usage data from the field trials (in a form that preserves privacy) and CampusMesh system software. Finally, the novel geotemporal matching algorithms and privacy mechanisms developed for this class of systems, and understanding of determinants of use of such systems, will be applicable in the military, government, and business sectors, as well as in academia.<br/>"

Three existing research laboratories will be connected and used as a testbed to facilitate this collaborative interdisciplinary research: High-Speed Networking & Performance Lab (HSNP), Media and Entertainment Technologies Lab (MET), and Media Interface and Network Design Lab (MIND). A primary objective of the proposed research is to further advance the client-server technologies for a ubiquitous multimedia computing environment. Since ubiquitous computing capability may take the form of advanced personal digitized assistants (PDAs), wearable computer systems featuring heads up displays, or argumented reality systems, this proposal addresses key issues which include: (1) personal environment data capture, (2) environmental data salience, (3) transport of multimedia data over wireless and heterogeneous network systems in a client-server environment, (4) media access and retrieval, and (5) human-computer-interface (HCI) design and analysis. Some of the significant questions that are addressed in the project are: (a) given continuous audio and video capture, what is the best choice of content to archive in a personal multimedia database? (b) how can audio and video capture of unconstrained content be used as an effective query mechanism for a multimedia database? (c) how can perceived latency and communications performance be optimized in a wireless environment where bandwidth, error rates, and latency are continuously variable and dependent upon many environmental conditions?, (d) how can the quality-of-service for the transport of real-time multimedia traffic be guaranteed using heterogeneous networks and wireless network systems?, and (e) what should be the design principles to support a fully mobile user engaged in hand-free high-bandwidth, collaborative work and communication? New algorithms and techniques will be developed and tested to address these questions either via simulation, emulation, or experimentation. It is anticipated that the existing facilities will be significantly enhanced via a pending NSF research equipment proposal. This proposed equipment (e.g., VoD servers, multimedia lap tops, WaveLan products, wearable argumented reality interfaces) will be the defining infrastructure to support a sophisticated testbed, connecting three research laboratories (HSNP, MET, MIND) via wireless links. The multi-lab testbed will be used for the experimental phase of the project. As an effort to broaden the participation in our research, the PIs will invite interested faculty (via two-week summer workshops) and students (via ten-week summer research experience) from HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) to work with them during the three summers.

The exploratory nature of using visualization makes quantitative measurements of individual components of the visualization task infeasible.  The range of potential users and their differing goals render standardized metrics too restrictive.  And environmental conditions can influence experimental outcomes, making it difficult to compare and generalize the results of separate evaluations.  Although numerous methods have been proposed for evaluating visualizations and HCI, few can be readily applied to objectively evaluate visual analytics systems in real-world settings.  In this project the PI will address this open challenge by developing a method to evaluate complex, interactive visual analytics systems using objective measures that can be performed in-situ to yield reproducible, generalizable results.  His approach is to integrate noninvasive brain imaging using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and cognitive factors measurements.  The PI argues this will allow him to address issues in visual analytics evaluation by explaining the user's cognitive processes at a deeper level.  Lightweight, noninvasive brain imaging techniques such as fNIRS have become more mature and reliable in recent years.  fNIRS is easy to set up, robust to movement, and has been demonstrated in studies to be effective in determining a user's cognitive load, preferences, and perception when using a visualization.  Cognitive factors such as locus of control, spatial visualization ability, and perceptual speed have recently been shown to correlate with a user's ability to interact with a visualization, and can be generalized to predict the behavioral patterns of users with different cognitive profiles.  Both approaches aim to better understand the user's cognitive state and abilities.  In this research cognitive factors measurements will provide low-level, baseline information about the user which is stable and unchanging (""traits""), while fNIRS provides immediate, real-time feedback on the user's current cognitive state when interacting with a visualization (""states"").  In practice, without accounting for the individual user's traits, it is difficult to generalize the signals provided by fNIRS (for example, right- and left-handed subjects produce very different brain signals).  By combining information on both ""traits"" and ""states,"" evaluation results can generalize to a larger population based on cognitive profiles.  The PI and his team have conducted two preliminary experiments that demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.  They have replicated the classic experiment by Cleveland and McGill using fNIRS, and successfully distinguished participants' brain signals when using bar charts versus pie charts.  In another experiment, they successfully correlated participants' locus of control with their ability to use hierarchical visualizations with different visual metaphors.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:   The results of this work will have both immediate and long term impact on the field of visualization.  In the short term, project outcomes will provide a robust and reliable evaluation mechanism for measuring the effectiveness of complex, interactive visual analytics systems.  Ultimately, the findings of this research will help open the human-cognition ""black box"" and illuminate how interacting with a visualization helps a user gain insight.  Such an understanding may in turn lead to the realization of insight-based evaluation and the emergence of a new visualization theory that is based on human cognitive processing.  Finally, by integrating real-time fNIRS into visual analytics systems, effective adaptive mixed-initiative visual analytics systems can become one step closer to reality."

This new instrument consists of a collection of new underwater glider robots, a computer cluster, and monitors for Human-CURI interaction (along with novel hardware and software), capable of exhibiting biologically inspired autonomous cooperative behaviors such as swarming, maneuvering efficiently, sensing, and making decisions. Among others goals, the work aims to be able to track and map a water mass over time and to assess how a water column mixing in ocean water drives local primary productivity over time. CURI, developed as a collaborative effort between the institution and Webb Research (manufacturers of current robotics gliders), will exhibit and allow<br/>- Biologically inspired behaviors such as swarming,<br/>- Decision making (in uncertain conditions) based on the integration of multi-dimensional, multi-scale, and multi-sensory data,<br/>- Human-CURI interaction to help guide the mission goals of the large number of underwater robotic vehicles, and<br/>- Underwater communication among the robots of the CURI based on the implementation of ideas from distributed and adaptive non-fixed topology networks which include middleware, metadata, and low power protocols for underwater communications.<br/>Leveraging significant NSF, ONR, NOAA, USGS, DHS, and other agency investments, CURI will be tested in the linked ecosystems of the densely populated NY-NJ metropolitan area, the Hudson River watershed and estuary, and the adjacent coastal ocean of the Mid-Atlantic, as well as Polar and Tropical environments. The diverse data gathered will provide foundation for computational analysis and modeling. <br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>This development has strong multidisciplinary components that involve control, algorithms, marine science, statistical learning, dynamic systems, human-computer interaction (HCI), and distributed systems. The work is applicable in many areas that involve large-scale, distributed modeling of coordinated behaviors of individual units and their interaction with the environment. Thus, current and future oceanographic applications are expected, including improved modeling of the Coastal Hydrologic Cycle and understanding how a human initiated act such as pollution, global warming, and over-fishing affects the coast, the atmosphere, and ultimately, the quality and security of human life in urbanized environment. CURI will influence the educational program. Courses will be developed and collaboration across disciplines will ensue.<br/>"

Distinct from previous approaches, the proposed approach quantifies the usability of each modality and then formalizes the adaptation issue as searching for a set of input/output modalities that produce the highest usability, i.e., an optimization issue. In addition to the interaction context, our approach also considers the effects of computing infrastructures (e.g., system resources and networking) on the modality adaptation. The proposed work establishes the first Natural Interaction Laboratory in North Dakota, enabling the following research projects in Adaptive Natural Interaction:<br/>- Establishing common interaction context across multiple scenarios,<br/>- Device-aware establishment of modality space,<br/>- Device-aware establishment of usability space, and<br/>- Quality of service in the human/computer interaction context.<br/>The work aims to develop a unifying infrastructure for research by providing a common programming interface across multiple devices. <br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>This instrumentation should provide a unique research facility for faculty and graduate students to conduct research on user interaction-enhancing technology and education.

It is primarily based on benchmarking the Visual Analytics Challenge 2010 (organized through the IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology ? known as VAST - symposium contest/challenge) as a test bed to generalize user-centered evaluation to assess the effectiveness of interactive systems that combine analytical reasoning, visual representations, Human Computer Interactions (HCI), complex algorithms, and collaboration tools.  At present, there are no standard methods for measuring the performance of interactive visual analytics systems as a whole.  Visual analysis systems are not well suited for traditional evaluation methods.  For example, simple methods such as precision and recall are not suitable and researchers rarely have had sufficient access to historical data sets with the complexity of the analytical problems that exist across wider, real-time domains.  The means of approach to executing this project encompasses three activities: 1) gathering diverse collation of datasets with associated ground truth/problem descriptions, 2) developing automatic metrics and subjective evaluation criteria to assess judgment, and 3) the investigation of the effectiveness and utility of these methods and lessons learned for re-use in other dynamic fields such as business, intelligence, medicine, emergency response, etc."

CSST was born out of a series of workshops sponsored by NSF involving over forty faculty members in diverse fields, such as social informatics, social computing, CSCW, computational social science, HCI, and information science. Workshop participants, recognizing the growing importance of research on the interplay of humans and technology, or socio-technical systems, proposed the CSST as a mechanism for promoting and supporting important research on social aspects of technological change. An identified high priority, even in advance of the formal creation of CSST, was initiation of an annual series of summer research institutes targeted at people entering the field of sociotechnical systems research. This proposal will support the second of these institutes to be held on the campus of the University of Michigan in July, 2009. The inaugural institute was very successful attracting 137 applications with a selected class of 31 participants and thirteen institute faculty. Student participants will include up to 30 advanced doctoral students and pre-tenure faculty doing research on socio-technical systems. Up to fifteen instructors will be drawn from senior faculty, including participants in the original NSF-supported workshops on sociotechnical systems. This project will support the travel, meals, and accommodations for all Institute participants.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The focus of the Institute will be on participants' research programs (e.g., dissertation for doctoral students).

To date, sign language recognition has focused primarily on detecting individual signs (words), articulated primarily with the arms and hands. This is a major limitation, given that critical linguistic information-including grammatical features such as negation, agreement, and question status-is conveyed through ""non-manual"" linguistic markings. These non-manual markings include facial expressions (such as raised or lowered eyebrows, varying gaze and aperture of the eyes, wrinkling of the nose, and mouth movements) and gestures or periodic movements of the head (such as tilts, nods, and shakes). No system for sign language recognition or generation can succeed without properly modeling the linguistic information produced both manually and non-manually.<br/><br/>The fact that these critical non-manual behaviors occur in parallel with manual signing, and that they are temporally aligned with phrases rather than with individual signs, greatly complicates the task. Further problems arise because of the difficulties of tracking the minute details of human facial movements from video, and the variations in the specific realizations (style) of manual signs and non-manual linguistic markings across different individuals, just as there is variation in the specific ways in which individuals produce a given spoken language. A comprehensive approach to ASL recognition thus requires the integration of information from multiple data sources with different spatial and temporal scales, the application of linguistic knowledge about both the manual and the non-manual aspects of ASL, and the modeling of interdependencies of activities in the manual and non-manual channels.<br/><br/>This collaborative project brings together the expertise of researchers in the fields of computer vision, linguistics, and recognition to achieve its goals. On the computer vision side, the principal investigators (PIs) will investigate the use of local free-form deformations and novel registration methods to enhance our existing face tracking software, so as to capture the minute details of the facial movements, and to improve robustness of the tracking. The tracking process results in a large number of facial parameters, which the researchers propose to reduce through nonlinear subspace manifold embedding. This embedding reduces the dimensionality of the parameter space, and more importantly, also results in a separation of style and content. Whereas style is specific to each signer, content captures the commonalities across all signers. Hence, by focusing on the content component, the PIs expect to be able to overcome the variations across signers and perform signer-independent recognition.<br/><br/>On the recognition side, the researhcers will combine the linguistic knowledge about facial microactions with computational clustering approaches to develop the necessary statistical models for recognition. Initially, these will be based on Hidden Markov Models from previous work by this research group and elsewhere; however, their power to describe the dynamical aspects of human movements is limited. To overcome these limitations, the PIs will research the use of Switching Linear Dynamic Systems, augmented by Coupled Dynamic Bayesian Networks to model and capture the interactions of the simultaneously occurring microactions. Linguists and computer scientists will collaborate in exploring the best ways to leverage information about the linguistic organization of ASL for improvement of recognition strategies.<br/><br/>This research will be performed on the existing linguistically annotated corpus of the National Center for Sign Language and Gesture Resources, as well as new data to be collected from 5-8 native ASL signers, which will also be annotated over the course of the project. The annotations will be used for the linguistic modeling; they also provide the ""ground truth"" for performing and validating the computer vision and recognition research.<br/><br/>Broader impact: <br/>The computer-based techniques for ASL can be extended to more general systems for sign language recognition and generation, as well as for interpretation of other types of human movements, such as face gesture recognition for HCI, surveillance, verification of identity, interrogation, interviews and medical diagnosis applications. The materials to be distributed will benefit researchers in linguistics, computer science, and other domains. There are immediate applications for primary and secondary education of the deaf and training of sign language interpreters. Improvements in multimedia (linguistic) information technology promise to offer expanded employment possibilities for the deaf, as well as improved access to vocational and post-secondary education. Finally, this project itself will provide a huge boost in terms of education, awareness and encouragement of deaf students in enabling them to work on cutting-edge research that directly affects them and their community."

Unfortunately, the visual nature of a typical number line or graph presents a major disability for those with visual impairment. In current practice in the United States, blind students learn graphs with tactile graphics, which often represent a graph using raised dots (similar to Braille) embossed on paper. Tactile graphics are useful and have their place, but are increasingly marginal for two reasons. First, most visually impaired students now are in ""mainstream"" classes with their sighted peers. Mainstreaming can be beneficial in many ways, but makes it less convenient to provide alternative formats to the student; furthermore, teachers and other students will typically be unable to read Braille. Second, many classrooms are using computers for learning mathematics and graphs. Tactile graphics are generally not compatible with computers, and the very few current tools that are compatible are rudimentary or extremely expensive.<br/><br/>On a standard desktop computer, a natural alternative to visuals is audio. The use of auditory displays for mathematical data and graphs is not a new concept, however much still needs to be done in order to make these auditory graphs useful in the school curriculum. In this project, the PI seeks to address this need by exploring the upcoming Common Core Standards for the teaching of graphs in middle school classrooms and establishing a software system to allow visually impaired and sighted middle school students to author and explore graphs using sound. The software system will go through an ecological validation process based on the identified goals and operations of the Common Core Standards, and will include optimal auditory display designs based on the PI's findings from planned auditory graph perception experiments in multiple data sets and conveying concepts such as uncertainty.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project opens a whole new field within assistive technology, making software-based accommodations possible and effective in the classroom. Students with vision loss stand to directly gain increased access to STEM materials from project outcomes; a solid STEM education will increase employability, which in turn will positively impact general income levels and quality of life for the members of this community. More broadly, however, it is clear that nearly all persons will benefit from appropriately designed and validated multimodal information displays. Thus, the background scientific knowledge that will be gained from this research will have foundational utility not only in this field but in many other disciplines as well, while the advances in curriculum-driven auditory graphing tools should lead to all manner of new uses for the technology in the field of education, HCI and beyond."

It will be extensible, modular, scalable, and well-structured, so students can easily write programs that range from one line all the way up to many thousands of lines.  Unlike most current environments for children, the system will support the creation of complete and sophisticated programs.  The PI will exploit modern technologies to simplify the programming process, including direct manipulation and demonstrational techniques, programming environment technologies like structure editors, and mechanisms for extending programs by harnessing and reusing existing components.  There has not been a successful new programming language for children in many years.  Since the PI's  system will be based on empirical studies of how children think, it should have an excellent chance of allowing the majority of children (and, by extension, the general public) to create interesting and useful applications<br/>http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~NatProg<br/>"

It permits simultaneous display of average and raw EEG of all channels and post-processing, source localization and co-registration with three-dimensional data sets such as MRI. The system includes: an ESI Reader Station with optical drive and local area network (LAN) connection to the main ESI system; a Neuro Scan STIM System interfaced to ESI for evoked potential and cognitive event-related potential testing; a Curry Multimodal Neuro-imaging software for integration of EEG/EP measurements with MRI and CT modalities. An infrared eye-gaze tracking system from LC Technologies will be interfaced with the larger system to allow the consolidation of eye-gaze with brain activities associated with readiness potentials.  The goal of the research is to develop an alternative form of brain-computer interface which is driven by the signals generated naturally by the body. It is particularly important for the large number of individuals who are physically limited in their access to computers.

The research will develop techniques for computer systems to communicate technical arguments to people without technical training, using integrated text and data graphics.  It will integrate empirical methods from computational linguistics and human-computer interaction.  Empirical methods will be used to determine appropriate techniques for conveying technical arguments to people with non-technical backgrounds.  Initially, the project will develop analytical methods based on a corpus of human-authored multimedia presentations.  For example, corpus studies can determine which features of arguments suggest where supporting graphics should be placed.  Next, human-computer interaction experiments will be used to determine the effectiveness of techniques based on the analytical models, and to investigate alternatives to the techniques that are shown not to be sufficient.  The resulting empirically-based techniques will be incorporated into computational models that will extend current approaches in natural language generation, automated graphic design, and intelligent multimedia presentation systems.  The computational models will be demonstrated with a prototype system for genetic counseling.  The educational component of this project will include new course curriculum, provide undergraduate and graduate computer science students with the opportunity to participate in research, and develop a laboratory for human-computer interaction studies that will be a resource for students and other faculty members.<br/><br/>This CAREER award recognizes and supports the early career-development activities of a teacher-scholar who is likely to become an academic leader of the twenty-first century.  Her research seeks solutions for the problem that people who lack appropriate technical training are faced with increasing responsibility for making vital decisions based on technical arguments, often involving quantitative and statistical data.  If successful in the area of genetic counseling, the approach could be applied to many other areas where decision makers need help in using technical information and analyses.<br/>"

The excessive cost of  software evolution is due in large part to  inappropriate structure of a system,  relative to the changes taking place.  Tool-assisted program restructuring is studied for changing a system's structure at lower cost and risk than  making  changes  by hand.  In this approach, a tool user selects transformations  to apply to chosen program components.  The tool checks to make sure that each  transformation will preserve the functional behavior of the program.  If so, it  performs the transformation to the chosen component and updates any related  components to preserve consistency.    Tool-assisted restructuring has not been  demonstrated to be practical in industrial-scale applications.  For  example, exhaustive interprocedural data flow analysis is required by some  tools, but is costly to perform on large programs. Previous restructuring  research has not addressed common complicating constructs such as pointer  arithmetic, function pointers, comments, textual macros, and conditional  compilation.    To make the restructuring of large programs practical, this  project is developing and adapting techniques to address these problems.  Demand-driven data flow is being investigated to overcome many performance  problems of exhaustive data flow analysis. Query prioritization and caching of  replies are studied to minimize burdensome and potentially incorrect user  queries. Testing and semantic differencing may also provide checks of  correctness after restructuring.  A case study is intended to  evaluate the  techniques developed and the benefits of large-scale  restructuring."

Traditional design of these integrated circuits has relied on the fact that these transistors have almost identical characteristics when they are initially made, and that the characteristics change little during their subsequent usage. Therefore, IC designers have worried about other things like the size of the IC, its speed, battery life, ease of debugging for errors, etc. And this traditional design approach has worked fine for last 25 years. But now-a-days the transistors are becoming so tiny that it is getting impossible to ensure that they have same geometrical and physical characteristics. Equally important, the characteristics of the small transistors can change rapidly when the consumer uses the product. ThePIs hope to answer the question as to how one can design an integrated circuit if one can no longer rely on the uniformity of the transistors, but must account for the fact that each transistor is slightly different and that its property changes with time. One can always assume the very worst case and design for the slowest transistor, but clearly that would be very wasteful. The project are proposes that a much better approach would be to first accurately understand why and how the transistor parameter change (of fluctuate) and to account for this variation explicitly from the very beginning of the IC design process. The design technique is no longer deterministic as it once were, but it now involves statistical design methodologies like making the slower transistors a little wider (transistor sizing) to compensate for their lack of speed or making sure that the architecture distributes the usage burden among a number of transistors so no one transistor becomes so slow that the IC fails. This new approach may allow one to make faster or less power-consuming ICs with a given set of transistors, because designers can now be more aggressive in their design. This in turn, may also allow more time to find alternatives to CMOS, and ease the eventual transition to post-CMOS devices and systems. <br/><br/>"
