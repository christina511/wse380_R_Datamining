Title = {{A serious game to improve engagement with web accessibility guidelines}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIOUR \& INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Designers are often faced with the challenge of following web
   accessibility guidelines that are complex and ambiguous, and therefore
   hard to use. This is evidenced by the low percentage of public websites
   that comply fully with web accessibility standards worldwide. Lack of
   engagement among designers to follow established web accessibility
   guidelines is often accounted for this issue. In this paper, we address
   designers' lack of engagement through a serious game called GATE which
   is based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). We followed
   a User-Centred approach by identifying user types of designers through
   an online survey. We then mapped these user types and the WCAG to
   relevant game mechanics. The resulting game was evaluated with designers
   for its perceived effectiveness, user engagement, and user satisfaction
   using a mixed methods approach. Our results demonstrate the potential of
   GATE which offers designers an innovative and engaging solution towards
   the wider adoption of web accessibility guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{Accessibility in immersive media is a relevant research topic, still in
   its infancy. This article explores the appropriateness of two rendering
   modes (fixed-positioned and always-visible) and two guiding methods
   (arrows and auto-positioning) for subtitles in 360 degrees video. All
   considered conditions have been implemented and integrated in an
   end-to-end platform (from production to consumption) for their
   validation and evaluation. A pilot study with end users has been
   conducted with the goals of determining the preferred options by users,
   the options that result in a higher presence, and of gathering extra
   valuable feedback from the end users. The obtained results reflect that,
   for the considered 360 degrees content types, always-visible subtitles
   were more preferred by end users and received better results in the
   presence questionnaire than the fixed-positioned subtitles. Regarding
   guiding methods, participants preferred arrows over auto-positioning
   because arrows were considered more intuitive and easier to follow and
   reported better results in the presence questionnaire.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional tests with written information used for the evaluation of
   sign language (SL) comprehension introduce distortions due to the
   translation process. This fact affects the results and conclusions drawn
   and, for that reason, it is necessary to design and implement the same
   language interpreter-independent evaluation tools. Novel web
   technologies facilitate the design of web interfaces that support
   online, multiple-choice questionnaires, while exploiting the storage of
   tracking data as a source of information about user interaction. This
   paper proposes an online, multiple-choice sign language questionnaire
   based on an intuitive methodology. It helps users to complete tests and
   automatically generates accurate, statistical results using the
   information and data obtained in the process. The proposed system
   presents SL videos and enables user interaction, fulfilling the
   requirements that SL interpretation is not able to cover. The
   questionnaire feeds a remote database with the user answers and powers
   the automatic creation of data for analytics. Several metrics, including
   time elapsed, are used to assess the usability of the SL questionnaire,
   defining the goals of the predictive models. These predictions are based
   on machine learning models, with the demographic data of the user as
   features for estimating the usability of the system. This questionnaire
   reduces costs and time in terms of interpreter dedication, as well as
   widening the amount of data collected while employing user native
   language. The validity of this tool was demonstrated in two different
   use cases.}},

Abstract = {{The design and implementation of effective and efficient biometric
   systems presents a series of challenges to information technology (IT)
   designers to ensure robust performance. One of the most important
   factors across biometric systems, aside from algorithmic matching
   ability, is the human interaction influence on performance. Changes in
   biometric system paradigms have motivated further testing methods,
   especially within mobile environments, where the interaction with the
   device has fewer environmental constraints, which may severely affect
   system performance. Testing methods involve the need for reflecting on
   the influence of user-system interaction on the overall system
   performance in order to provide information for design and testing. This
   paper reflects on the state of the art of biometric systems interaction
   assessment, leading to a comprehensive document of the relevant research
   and standards in this area. Furthermore, the current challenges are
   discussed and thus we provide a roadmap for the future of biometrics

Title = {{User Experience Affects Dropout from Internet-Delivered Dialectical
   Behavior Therapy}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background: The emergence of computerized treatment may help reduce the
   gap between mental health treatment needs and accessibility, but
   unfortunately, dropout from these interventions is often high.
   Introduction: To increase the effectiveness of computerized
   interventions and reduce dropout, particularly among high-risk and
   clinically complex populations, better understanding of how usable and
   acceptable (i.e., user experience) these interventions are, informed by
   human computer interaction research, is needed. This study examines user
   experience of internet-delivered dialectical behavior therapy (iDBT).
   The major aim is to explore whether treatment dropout was affected by
   the complexity of population and/or user experience. Methods: Secondary
   analyses were conducted using data from a randomized controlled trial
   that evaluated iDBT in a sample of 59 suicidal and heavy episodic
   drinkers. Multivariate logistic regression and chi-square tests were
   performed to examine the roles of clinical characteristics and user
   experience in differentiating dropouts and nondropouts. Results: The
   only significant pretreatment predictor of dropout was the presence of a
   barrier, with technological and unknown barriers being most strongly
   associated with dropping. No clinical characteristics emerged as
   significant predictors of dropout. Discussion: The current results
   highlight technological problems as a possible barrier to adherence to
   computerized interventions. Future research would profit from increased
   integration of human-computer interaction to identify and solve user
   experience problems.}},

Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Sign languages (SL) are the first language for most deaf people.
   Consequently, bidirectional communication among deaf and non-deaf people
   has always been a challenging issue. Sign language usage has increased
   due to inclusion policies and general public agreement, which must then
   become evident in information technologies, in the many facets that
   comprise sign language understanding and its computational treatment. In
   this study, we conduct a thorough systematic mapping of
   translation-enabling technologies for sign languages. This mapping has
   considered the most recommended guidelines for systematic reviews, i.e.,
   those pertaining software engineering, since there is a need to account
   for interdisciplinary areas of accessibility, human computer
   interaction, natural language processing, and education, all of them
   part of ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) computing
   classification system directly related to software engineering. An
   ongoing development of a software tool called SYMPLE (SYstematic Mapping
   and Parallel Loading Engine) facilitated the querying and construction
   of a base set of candidate studies. A great diversity of topics has been
   studied over the last 25 years or so, but this systematic mapping allows
   for comfortable visualization of predominant areas, venues, top authors,
   and different measures of concentration and dispersion. The systematic
   review clearly shows a large number of classifications and
   subclassifications interspersed over time. This is an area of study in
   which there is much interest, with a basically steady level of
   scientific publications over the last decade, concentrated mainly in the
   European continent. The publications by country, nevertheless, usually
   favor their local sign language.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives:ADVOS multi is a recirculating albumin-based dialysis device
   that supports kidney, liver and lung function by eliminating CO2,
   water-soluble and protein-bound substances. In the present work in vitro
   data on the removal of these substances and CO2 are presented. Methods:
   An ex vivo model using porcine blood was established and applied in
   detoxification tests for water soluble and protein bound retention
   solutes. 3 x 3.3L of blood with high bilirubin (30 mg/dl) and lactate
   levels (>10 mmol/l) were treated with ADVOS multi for 4 hours each. This
   design, with 3 phases changing blood every 4 hours, led to high
   concentrations of both markers in blood during the 12 h test period. For
   CO2 removal tests, 5 liters of blood were used instead. In both cases, a
   continuous CO2 supply through an additional dialyzer was applied.
   Results: Bilirubin and lactate were efficiently removed during 12hrs of
   in vitro detoxification. Lactate removal rates were 90\%, 86\% and 84\%
   for phase 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Bilirubin elimination rates were
   66\%, 62\%, and 57\%, resulting in a total elimination of 1150 mg in 12
   hrs. Albumin binding capacity was determined to be >76\% at the end of
   the treatment indicating that albumin was not denatured in the dialysate
   of the ADVOS system. CO2 removal with ADVOS multi depends on three
   variables: 1) The amount of supplied CO2 depends on concentrate flow
   affecting both, blood pCO2 and bicarbonate levels; 2) blood flow, and 3)
   dialysate pH and composition (i.e., carbonate concentration). A maximum
   CO2 removal of 142 ml/min was achieved with a carbonate-free dialysate
   at pH 10, a blood flow of 400 ml/min and a concentrate flow of 160
   ml/min. Given that blood gases are maintained within physiological
   conditions, a CO2 removal rate of 61 ml/min can be achieved. During all
   the experiments blood pH was set to 7.35-7.45. Discussion:ADVOS multi is
   a device using albumin recirculation in its secondary circuit. Here,
   albumin binding capacity remains stable through a systematic
   modification of its tertiary structure through temperature and pH
   changes in the ADVOS multi circuit. This facilitates the release of
   toxins from albumin and allows for further binding. Moreover, presence
   of albumin, variable dialysate composition and the flexible dialysate pH
   might facilitate the treatment of patients with multiple organ failure.
   Objectives:Given the extent of bypass graft failure, the motivation
   behind this multidisciplinary project is to improve the patency of the
   current bypass grafts by developing a novel and optimised blood flow
   augmentation technique. Methods: One of the most significant
   contributions to the improvement of haemodynamics in grafts was based on
   a research which showed that the `spiral flow' is a natural phenomenon
   in the whole arterial system and is induced by the twisting of the left
   ventricle during contraction and then accentuated upon entering the
   aortic arch. The benefit of this flow pattern lies in removing
   unfavourable haemodynamic environment such as turbulence, stagnation and
   oscillatory shear stress, which are believed to be the main causes of
   intimal hyperplasia at anastomotic configurations. Results:This
   multi-disciplinary engineering venture has resulted in a unique product
   which makes use of both non-planar helicity and an optimised internal
   ridge within the graft to achieve a significantly improved haemodynamic
   condition within the anastomosis (an anastomosis is a surgical
   connection between autologous/prosthetic grafts and veins/arteries
   inside the human body) Discussion:This truly multidisciplinary project
   has integrated fluid mechanics, biomechanics and biology with
   cardiovascular surgery to develop a novel biomedical device, inspired by
   the nuclear engineering sector. The novel spiral-inducing bypass graft,
   nominated for this award, is the best example of how engineering
   techniques, tools and designs can lead to life-saving innovations that
   could potentially save the lives of thousands of people and save
   millions of pounds for the healthcare systems across the world. Such
   successful engineering stories are what would encourage the next
   generation of engineers to go beyond the traditional boundaries of
   engineering disciplines to make a difference.
   Objectives:The goal of this work was to study methods that will allow
   increase in spatial freedom of couplers orientation in inductive
   powering unit for implantable medical devices. An inductive energy
   transfer system is considered, therefore the freedom of relative
   orientation of the transmitting and receiving coils must be optimized.
   Methods:The design procedure of inductive powering unit (IPU) consists
   of two main steps: design of the power amplifier and optimization of an
   inductive link. To account for the patient specifics, such as tissue
   thickness near the implantation site, a number of different couplers
   were simulated using finite element modeling. Effect of coils
   geometrical parameters on mutual inductance and inductive link
   efficiency was examined. Class E power amplifier was chosen as a driver
   for the transmitting coil. Capacitors in the amplifier loading network
   were tuned to achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS). A patient's everyday
   activity, including walking and even breathing, leads to misalignment of
   the transmitting and receiving coils, and, as a result, detuning of the
   amplifier from ZVS and increased losses. Feedback schemes were studied
   to compensate the misalignments effect on the amplifier. Results:A
   self-oscillating IPU with class E amplifier was designed that provides
   stable output power about 0.5 W for the distance between the couplers in
   range 10-20 mm and the lateral distance up to 20 mm. The use of
   self-oscillating circuit in the transmitter increases spatial freedom of
   the transmitting and receiving coils corresponding to ZVS. Discussion:
   Inductive link geometrical parameters optimization and implementation of
   self-oscillating class E driver the IPU contributes to stable output
   power and efficiency of IPU. As a result, less intervention from the
   patient and physician is required, and patient quality of life is
   increased Precision medicine emerges from integration of a number of
   emerging technologies and the data they produce with modern data
   analytics. For precision diagnostics and for predicting drug responses
   new computational and in-vitro models are needed from gene regulation to
   cellular and organ functions. Human induced pluripotent stem cells
   (hIPSC) derived e.g., from patient blood cells provide means to produce
   most cell types and thus provide means to get patient specific in-vitro
   models. New technologies are needed to produce tissues from these cells
   and to assess the cell functions in-vitro. In addition, computational
   in-silico models can be used to augment our understanding of the
   diseases or drug effects. They also provide tools to translate the
   in-vitro findings to clinical settings and patient populations. We are
   in transition to turn our in-vitro cell culture models to body-on-chip
   platforms including environmental control and biophysical functional
   sensing. We have developed methods to assess the cellular functions
   based on electrophysiological sensing as well as 2D and 3D bioimaging.
   For example, we have developed imaging methods to assess functions of
   hIPSC cardiac cell with simultaneous assessment of electrophysiology
   such as Calcium and voltage transients as well as mechanobiology in
   vitro. Further, we have developed in-silico models of various cellular
   function including multi-cell-type neuronal networks and in-silico
   population models of the hIPSC cardiomyocytes. The later ones are
   providing us ionic machinery of hIPSC derived cardiomyocyte
   electrophysiology in various populations of patiets.
   We have shown that these computational models can represent pathological
   patient phenotype cells and populations of patients with specific
   mutations, e.g., long QT syndrome. We have also demonstrated the power
   of in-silico as possible pre-screening method for drug effects prior to
   in-vitro examinations. Moreover, our in-silico results highlight the
   need of careful consideration of use of HiPSC models before they can be
   turned from immature cell models to mature tissues in vitro. With
   integration of novel engineering expertise from multimodal sensing,
   imaging and computational modelling, we have shown their power on
   studying diseases and for pre-screening of compounds. Our results
   demonstrate the power of combined in-vitro and in-silco methods for
   future precision medicine.
   Objectives: We have developed in vivo tissue engineered autologous
   vascular grafts constructed in the subcutaneous of the recipient body.
   However, since the formation of the vascular grafts depends on the
   conditions of recipients including high risk or immature patients,
   immaturity in the fabricated tissues might be problematic for the
   severely diseased patients because of their suppressed regenerative
   activity. Therefore, possibility of the xenogeneic or the allogeneic
   implantation of the grafts should be evaluated. The objective of this
   study is to fabricate cardiovascular grafts using xenogeneic or
   allogeneic animals. Methods: Silicone rod molds were placed into
   subcutaneous pouches of beagle dogs, and after 4 weeks the implants with
   their surrounded connective tissues were harvested. Those were
   decellularized with detergents and stored at -20 degrees C for 1 week.
   Decellularized tubular connective tissues (internal diameter: 2 mm) were
   xeno-transplanted to abdominal aorta of the rats. Decellularized tubular
   connective tissues (internal diameter: 5 mm) were cut open and trimmed
   to elliptical sheets of 15 x 8 mm, they were allo-transplanted to
   carotid arteries of other beagle dogs as vascular patches. Results: Both
   xenogeneic vascular grafts and allogeneic patch grafts performed well
   after transplantation, and the luminal surfaces after resection were
   very smooth. Histological evaluation also showed host cells infiltration
   into the grafts. Discussion: Decellularized xenogeneic and allogeneic
   connective tissue membranes could be ideal vascular grafts.
   Objectives: This work aimed to print high-resolution, collagen-based,
   constructs via suspended 3D printing with load-bearing and compositions
   closer to native bone; for potential use as implant materials. Methods:
   Collagen type I (Col) and gelatin methacroylate (GelMA) blends were
   systematically investigated as bio-inks, probing their rheological
   properties and crosslinking efficiency for printing. An adapted 3D
   bioprinter (3DDiscovery, regenHU, Switzerland) based on an extrusion
   principle was used to print constructs. Calcification was investigated,
   in vitro, using a polymer-induced liquid precursor for the
   mineralization process. Results: Careful control over the formulation
   and processing resulted in refined construct properties such as: wall
   width (500um), lattice length (2cm) and shape (bone trabeculae). Once
   printed, the ability to cure the GelMA/Col blends was dependent on
   photo-polymerisation methodology, with enhanced curing and lower
   remaining soluble fractions (10\% vs 40\%) for visible light +
   Riboflavin/SPS in comparison to UV + Irgacure. Control over the
   construct structure allowed defined mineralisation, and subsequent
   material responses. Discussion: In recent years the development of 3D
   printing technologies has attempted to combat the growing need for bone
   repair solutions, although is limited by the number of bio-inks, and
   printable resolutions available. Suspended manufacture has sought to
   address this issue, using a fluid gel to support a secondary
   biologically relevant bio-ink whilst it undergoes a curing step, during
   or post-printing. To date, printing techniques have not been shown to
   provide fully resorbable and/or mechanically satisfactory bone implants.
   This research has shown promise as the first steps towards printing high
   resolution constructs with chemical compositions more closely matching
   that of natural bone. Further works involve deeper investigation of
   calcification and impact on implants mechanical properties and
   microstructure.
   Shifting from treating symptoms to curing chronic diseases by making the
   transformative promise of Advanced Therapies a reality for the benefit
   of patients and society and by making Europe a spearhead of Advanced
   Therapies in Science, Clinics and Biomedical Industry, that is the
   vision of the large-scale research initiative RESTORE - Health by
   Advanced Therapies. The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and
   multi-morbidity due to demographic factors represents a high
   socio-economic burden for Europe. The direct health costs increased by
   50\% during the last decade and reached euro1.526bn in 2017, a
   staggering 9.6 \% of Europe's GDP. As current therapies rarely cure, but
   merely fight symptoms, never-ending treatment is required, which means
   diminished quality-of-life, adverse effects and soaring cost for
   society. There is a high need to reach sustainable improvement for
   patients or even to cure them of chronic diseases - in other words, to
   disrupt the paradigm of ``treating symptoms{''} with ``restoring
   health{''}. Advanced Therapies are the game changers that open up
   transforming therapeutic opportunities. For genetic diseases, immune
   diseases, cancer and tissue injury potential cures through Advanced
   Therapies exist - it is reality, not fiction. Some products are already
   on the market, mostly for rare diseases which means only a few thousand
   patients worldwide have benefitted from Advanced Therapies until now. At
   the advent of such a trailblazing change, obstacles and roadblocks
   abound. To make the disruptive promise of Advanced Therapies to cure
   chronic diseases a reality and to make Advanced Therapies accessible as
   standard-of-care for every European patient in need, RESTORE envisage to
   establish a sustainable pan-European ecosystem integrating
   transdisciplinary research, clinics, patients, and industry. Please join
   us for more details. RESTORE is funded by the EU for the preparatory
   phase of the large-scale research initiative (h2020, No 820292).
   Our main objective is to develop safe medical products for a
   minimally-invasive surgical intervention that fulfill all requirements
   by the new Medical Device Regulation (MDR). The secondary objective is
   to minimize the time to market by implementing standard conforming
   processes in a minimalistic way so they can be operated by only a
   handful of people. The twist in the story is that one of our products of
   our system will be individualized in the operating theater. While
   basically everybody is forced to operate in a ``learning by doing{''}
   mode regarding MDR compliance, we do rely on external trainings provided
   by notified bodies and other sources like websites, webinars, and
   dedicated conferences to learn more about how to fulfil regulatory
   requirements. Additionally, we are partnering with our strategic
   investor (a manufacturer of class-III implantable active devices) to
   receive trainings and advice regarding regulatory affairs. However, it
   has to be stressed that one has to consider all parts of the MDR,
   especially the annexes and the applicable norms. Here we present our
   technical approach and our strategy on how we aim full MDR compliance.
   We established a completely digital workflow for all our documents,
   including cryptographic signatures, version history, reviews, mainly
   based on open source tools. This allows us to handle the document
   management very swiftly. We have one person dedicated to our quality
   management system. The risk management is integrated as a
   cross-cutting-concern into all the product development processes. The
   main challenge in the planning and founding phase of OtoJig GmbH was and
   still is to estimate what has to be done, which norms do apply, and how
   much effort (time and money) it is to perform the steps and create all
   the required documents. A difficulty is that contradicting statements
   between the MDR and other applicable norms are still under
   interpretation and public discussion.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is to study the influence of person
   physiology and anatomy, which include postoperative edema, movement and
   breathing of a patient, on the results of designing of inductive
   powering unit (IPU) for VAD and to propose design recommendations.
   Methods: A characteristic feature of the IPU is the misalignment of the
   coils. The stability of the VAD power supply (especially with continuous
   powering) is very important. Therefore, it is necessary to design an IPU
   tolerant to coil misalignment. The procedure of geometrical optimization
   for increasing the stability of energy transfer of IPU was performed for
   3 axial distances between coils d (8, 10, 12 mm), which is a typical
   misalignment with a postoperative edema. The lateral misalignment of the
   coils reached the value of the outer radius of the receiving coil (35
   mm), which characterizes the patient movement or breathing. The
   operating frequency was taken 1 MHz, and the output power of the system
   was 10 W. The power drop was within 10\%. The results were verified by
   numerical simulation in MATLAB and PSpice. Results: It was found that
   with a decrease of d from 12 to 10 and 8 mm, the optimal outer radius of
   the transmitting coil increases from 53.9 to 54.6 and 55.7 mm. Turn
   pitch in the transmitting coil increases from 4.9 to 5.2 and 5.3 mm. For
   a receiving coil, turns pitch is increasing from 3 to 3.2 and 3.6,
   respectively. For all cases of d in each coil there are 11 turns (except
   for d = 8 mm, where there are 10 turns in the receiving coil). It is
   recommended to design coils with a slightly larger coils turns pitch and
   the outer radius of the transmitting coil because of disappearance of
   postoperative edema. Discussion: In this work, the influence of person
   physiology and anatomy on the design of IPU for VAD was investigated,
   and recommendations for designing were given.
   Objectives: Membrane oxygenators are an indispensable part of critical
   care medicine. Though necessary to supply sufficient gas exchange, the
   high intrinsic surface introduced by the hollow fiber packing has
   serious side effects on blood platelet parameters. To reduce these side
   effects the membrane surface must be minimized and gas exchange
   improved. Methods: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can support
   oxygenator optimization and supplement experimental data by delivering a
   spatial and temporal resolution of the gas exchange. While current
   research mostly focusses on the gas transport in the blood flow, this
   work presents a fully resolved CFD approach including transmembrane
   transport as well as convective and diffusive blood gas transport on
   shell- and lumen-side of the hollow fibers. Results: CO2 transport in a
   packing segment of a prototype hollow fiber module was fully resolved
   and simulated utilizing an inhouse solver membraneFoam based on the open
   source CFD code OpenFOAM (R). Simulation results show a CO2 partial
   pressure decline from 50 to 15 mmHg in the laminar boundary layer and an
   additional drop of 12 mmHg at the selective membrane surface. Boundary
   conditions for the gas transport simulations were computed by blood flow
   simulations of the whole module. Simulation results were compared to in
   vitro tests comprising measurements of CO2 exchange performance and
   blood side pressure drop of the prototype module. Discussion: Flow
   simulations predict the experimentally determined pressure drop of 68
   mmHg at blood flow rates of 1280 mL/min accurately. The specific CO2
   exchange rate of 220 mL STP/min/m2 is overpredicted due to the reduction
   of the whole packing to an idealized packing segment. Nevertheless, CFD
   allows for a structured optimization of membrane oxygenators as design
   changes can be efficiently investigated.
   Objectives: Anticoagulation therapy in LVAD patients is essential to
   reduce hemocompatibility related adverse events (HRAE). Phenprocoumon
   dose must be adapted and monitored by INR point-of-care-testing (POCT)
   in outpatients. The study aims to determine if the frequency of INR POCT
   in LVAD outpatients has an influence on the quality of anticoagulation
   therapy, HRAE and clinical outcomes. Methods: This retrospective,
   pseudo-randomized study included n=48 patients who received an LVAD
   implantation (HMII, HM3 and HVAD) between Jan. 2012 and Oct. 2016. Based
   on the frequency of weekly INR POCT, we compared a daily (n=36) and a
   3x/week (n=12) group, specifically the 1-year anticoagulation quality
   (\% of INR Tests in Range) as well as clinical outcomes, readmissions
   and HRAE using Kaplan-Meier curves. Readmission profiles and outcomes in
   three groups, based on the achieved quality of anticoagulation (\% of
   INR Tests in Range) ranging from 0-60\% (poor), 60-70\% (acceptable),
   70-100\% (well controlled) were compared. Results: Daily and 3x/week
   groups were similar in demographic and pre-operative risk factors, INR
   target (2.0-3.0, p=0.27) and Aspirin daily doses (p=0.29). Freedom from
   any HRAE (38.9\% vs. 25.0\%, p=0.44), any readmission (72.2\% vs.
   75.0\%, p=0.97) and 1-year survival (91.7\% vs. 91.7\%, p=0.98) were
   comparable in both groups. The \% of INR Tests in Range was
   significantly higher with the daily self-assessments (73.5\% vs. 68.4\%,
   p=0.006). Freedom from any neurological event (91.7\% vs. 75.0\%,
   p=0.14) was n.s. higher in the daily POCT group. Well vs. poorly
   controlled INR POCT patients had a significant higher freedom from any
   neurological event (96.0 vs 69.2\%, p=0.024) as well as hemorrhagic
   strokes (100\% vs. 76.9\%, p=0.011). Discussion: Well controlled
   anticoagulation of LVAD outpatients results in less neurological events
   including hemorrhagic stroke. Daily INR POCT and subsequent dose
   adjustment of vitamin-K antagonists result in a better quality of
   anticoagulation than 3x/week checks.
   Objectives: Spectroscopic method is widely used for non-invasive blood
   glucose (BG) measurement. Despite the progress in implementation of
   transmission NIR-spectroscopic method, applicable mostly for earlap
   measurements, research of non-transmission methods allows for the
   exapnsion of spectroscopy range of use. The aim of research is to
   estimate the penetration depth for 1600 nm radiation using reflection
   NIR-spectroscopy. Sufficiency of penetration depth on this wavelength
   would allow for the use of a mathematical model implemented in the
   transmission method. Methods: The developed experimental setup includes
   a semiconductor laser with wavelength of 1600 nm, two photodiodes,
   reflecting surface, control unit and power supply. For determining the
   position of optical elements a MATLAB program was developed, which
   calculated efficient detected radiation intensity depending on distances
   between the photodiode and the laser and between the laser and
   reflective surface. Scheme for measuring BG by reflection
   NIR-spectroscopy partially repeats the scheme used for transmission
   method. The main differences are in location of photodiodes on the same
   plane with the radiation source, while their optical axes are co-aligned
   and parallel to each other, and the reflecting surface tightly abuts the
   back wall of analytical cell with test solution. Results: The optimal
   distance between the photodiode and the laser is 5 mm, and between the
   laser and the reflective surface is 20 mm. This configuration allows
   intensity of the reflected radiation at about 20\% of incident radiation
   to be obtained. Taking into account the permissible radiation density
   for skin, this value is enough for skin probing to a depth of 1.5 mm.
   Discussion: Reflection NIR-spectroscopy is promising method for
   non-invasive BG measurement. Research of transmission method has shown
   that the penetration depth of 1.5 mm is enough for receiving information
   about BG. Thereby mathematical apparatus applied for transmission
   NIR-spectroscopy can be used and similar error less than 20\% can be
   expected.
   Objectives: Proper anatomical fitting of implants is crucial for a
   successful clinical outcome. However, every patient's anatomy is unique
   and there is a wide variety in the anatomical and morphological
   characteristics among individuals. Virtual fitting based on imaging data
   of a high number of patients has crucial benefits compared to
   conventional approaches during the design process. Methods: Population
   based engineering is a method that enables a virtual implantation
   combined with iterative design optimization based on 3D anatomical
   models created from imaging data of a high cohort of patients. This
   approach was successfully used during the design process of a novel
   inflow cannula for a Ventricular Assist Device and a Total Artificial
   Heart for maximizing the number of treatable patients. The objective was
   to create a design that contains all components, but which at the same
   time works for a wide variety of different body types and sizes.
   Results: The virtual studies have proven to give results that may not
   have been possible with conventional approaches. Compared with cadaver
   studies, this approach was a more accurate and economical way for
   determining the device fit and identifying areas for improvement.
   Clinical trials and in vivo studies of the devices have shown positive
   outcomes. Virtual fitting was able to reduce the risk of inflow
   obstruction, device-vessel misalignment, unexpected variabilities in the
   patient's anatomy and improper patient selection due to anatomical
   constraints. Discussion: Population based engineering is a
   cost-effective solution for including a large number of patients and
   anatomy variations in the design process. Additionally, this approach
   can be used for regulatory submission, e.g. to determine and justify
   anatomical and morphological eligibility or exclusion criteria for
   proper patient selection and/or the correct implant size. This is
   especially important in consideration of the future requirements of the
   Medical Device Regulation (MDR) for patient-specific implants.
   Objectives: None Alcoholic Fatty Liver disorders (NAFLD)is a complex
   systemic disorder becauseit is associated with clinical states such as
   obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes thus involving both
   liver and pancreas. In particular, pathological pancreas (such as in
   diabetic patients, in non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disorders patients)
   led to mis control of insulin secretion (the insulin modulates the lipid
   accumulation in liver). Methods: Organ on chip approaches is one way to
   mimic human physiology. In this paper, we will present the development
   of a liver, pancreas and liver pancreas co-culture model to simulate the
   interaction between both organs. Results: The morphological analysis
   confirmed the rat hepatocytes and the rat Langehrans islets were
   cultivated successfully after the extraction for 7 days. The tissues
   functionality was confirmed by the production of albumin in the liver on
   chip models and by the insulin secretion in the pancreas biochips. The
   RTqPCR analysis confirmed that the pancreas on chip culture contribute
   to maintain high level mRNA of genes related to glucose insulin
   homeostasis when compared to Petri control. Then, the GLP1 drug
   contribute to increase the insulin metabolism in pancreas on chip. In
   liver pancreas co-culture, we found that the presence of pancreas islet
   contributed to modify the mRNA levels of glucose-insulin homeostasis
   related genes in the hepatocytes. It also contributed to increase the
   insulin production when compared to pancreas biochip control.
   Discussion: Those results demonstrated the potential of our liver
   pancreas model to be upgraded to a complex disease model.
   Objectives: We are developing a novel autologous tissue-engineered heart
   valve with a unique in-body tissue engineering. This is expected to be a
   viable bioprosthesis with better biocompatibility. In this study, we
   developed a conduit-type valve without any foreign materials and tested
   the feasibility and long-term availability in large animal experiments.
   Methods: We created plastic molds for Biovalves with a 3D printer easily
   and quickly considering the recipient character. We embedded them in the
   subcutaneous spaces of adult goats for about 2 months. After extracting
   the molds with the tissue en-block and removing the plastic molds only,
   Biovalves with tri-leaflets similar to those of the native valves were
   constituted from completely autologous connective tissues and
   fibroblasts. Total 21 conduit-type Biovalves were implanted in the
   apico-aortic bypass or the pulmonary artery of goats, (8 and 13,
   respectively). No anticoagurants were used after implantation. Results:
   The valves were successfully implanted and showed smooth movement of the
   leaflets with a little regurgitation in angiogram, and the maximum
   duration reached to 3 years 7 months. Histological examination of the
   Biovalves showed the autologous cells covering the laminar surface of
   the valve leaflets as the endothelium and also migrating into the
   leaflet body to construct characteristic tissues like native leaflets.
   Discussion: The valves have a potential to be used for viable
   bioprosthetic valves and to keep better function and biocompatibility
   longer than current ones.
   Objectives: The main purpose of this study is to analyze the correlation
   between different types of dnDSA and AMR after renal transplantation.
   Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the patients after renal
   transplantation from January 2002 to March 2017 in our Center. A total
   of 47 patients with positive PRA and confirmed as dnDSA were included,
   which were grouped according to the DSA binding to C1q, C3d and subtypes
   of IgG. Patients were divided into AMR and non-AMR groups according to
   the pathology of graft biopsy. Results: The pre-transplantation dialysis
   time of the non-AMR group was longer than that of the AMR group in 47
   patients with dnDSA positive (35.4 +33.2 vs 9.8 +10.5, p=0.014).
   C1q-binding dnDSA had no significant effect on the graft survival after
   operation and biopsy. Among 47 patients with dnDSA positive, C3d-binding
   DSA group had lower graft survival time (p=0.009), higher HLA-DP
   mismatch (0.1 +/- 0.3, p=0.043) and higher percentage of pericapillary
   C4d deposition (p=0.042), with statistical significance. The graft
   survival rate of IgG3 subtype negative patients was higher than that of
   IgG3 subtype positive patients (p=0.003). Cox analysis found that the
   risk factors for graft survival included IgG3 (OR = 46.877, 95\% CI =
   4.211-521.830, P = 0.002), HLA-DR mismatch (OR = 0.103, 95\% CI =
   0.021-0.496, P = 0.005), proteinuriuria at biopsy (OR = 2.097, 95\% CI =
   1.184-3.713, p=0.024) and creatinine at biopsy (OR = 1.004, 95\% CI =
   1.001-1.007, P = 1.007) Discussion: Single-center study showed that
   there was no significant correlation between the incidence of AMR and
   different types of DSA. The accurate HLA-DR typing should be emphasized
   during transplantation. The monitoring of specific types of dnDSA will
   help us to take interventions and thus contribute to the survival of
   transplanted kidneys.
   Objectives: Rotary blood pumps (RBPs) are successfully used in high-risk
   treatments, but clot formation still threatens their long-term
   application. To reduce the risk of clot formation, in-vitro
   thrombogenicity testing could help to improve RBP design, as several
   studies have shown. Those studies were able to simulate in-vitro clot
   formation in RBPs, but they had limitations regarding a proper
   quantification of their thrombotic impact. In this study, we assessed if
   thromboelastometric analyses (TEM) are feasible to quantify the
   thrombotic impact of RBPs in-vitro. Methods: Five RBPs (n = 5) were
   placed into simple pump circuits that were built of silicone tubes and
   reservoirs. Each circuit was filled with 150 ml of slightly heparinized
   porcine blood (one donor pig per circuit) and the pumps were brought
   into operation. The pumps operated until a drastic drop in volume flow
   indicated thrombus formation. We carefully cleaned the RBPs from blood
   and documented any found thrombus. Prior to this, blood samples were
   taken at certain time points during pump operation. The blood samples
   were then analyzed by TEM. Results: TEM measurements showed a decrease
   in clotting time (CT) over the duration of the test, which indicates an
   ongoing increase in the activation of the coagulation system caused by
   the pump. Correspondingly, RBPs revealed visible blood clots at
   high-risk thrombus formation spots. Discussion: The decrease in CT over
   time corresponding to clot formation in the RBPs shows that TEM is able
   to detect and quantify the thrombotic impact of RBPs in-vitro. Thus, TEM
   could be used in future studies to compare the thrombogenicity of
   different RBPs by performing comparison tests similar to hemolysis
   testing. This could lead towards a standardization of in-vitro
   thrombogenicity testing of RBPs.
   Objectives: Cryopreservation of tissue-engineered constructs (TECs) is
   very important to provide such ready-to-use products for regenerative
   medicine and clinical application upon demand. Although cryopreservation
   of isolated cells seems to be well established, there are still a number
   of challenges associated with the cryopreservation of native and
   artificial tissues due to adherent cell state, limited heat and mass
   transfer as well as inadequate cryopreservation protocols. Here, we aim
   at developing an approach for efficient cryopreservation of electrospun
   TECs based on multipotent stromal cells (MSCs). Methods: Blend
   electrospun fibre mats (fibre diameter 0.8 +/- 0.2 mu m, thickness 100
   +/- 10 mu m) were produced from polycaprolactone and polylactic acid
   (PCL-PLA, ratio 100:50) using electrospinning. The fibre mats (diameter
   16 mm) were UV sterilised and seeded with MSCs (5x104 cells/cm2). The
   cells were cultivated on fibre mats for 7 days under static conditions
   and then frozen using 1 K/min cooling rate in a controlled rate freezer
   with different formulations of cryoprotective agents (CPAs), such as
   dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and its combination with sucrose (with and
   without pre-culture with sucrose for 24 h). The viability of cells
   growing on fibre mats was monitored for 2 weeks after seeding and 24 h
   after thawing. Results: The results indicate that PCL-PLA fibre mats are
   biocompatible with MSCs (viability higher than 82\%). Pre-culture with
   sucrose before freezing as well as its addition to DMSO-containing
   freezing medium significantly improved cell viability after thawing.
   Moreover, duration of equilibration of cell-seeded fibre mats with the
   CPAs before freezing affected cell viability post-thaw. Discussion: We
   showed that it is feasible to effectively cryopreserve electrospun TECs
   using controlled technological steps. This work could serve as a solid
   background for further development of efficient cryopreservation methods
   for biobanking of electrospun constructs for vascular or corneal tissue
   engineering.
   Objectives: There have been discussions on effects of pleural effusion
   on the breathing muscles dynamics. In particular, hemidiaphragm
   inversion influence on the pleural pressure (PPL) and ventilation
   parameters has not been precisely determined. The aim of this study was
   to analyze changes in PPL and ventilation parameters in patients
   undergoing therapeutic thoracentesis (TT). Particular attention has been
   paid to inversion of the hemidiaphragm caused by large one-sided pleural
   effusion. The analysis was based on virtual experiments performed on an
   artificial cardio-respiratory patient (AP). Methods: TT was simulated on
   AP, which consists of several cooperating models of the respiratory
   system mechanics, gas transport and exchange, and circulation. Three
   scenarios were considered: a) proper work of the diaphragm, b)
   flattening and fixation of the hemidiaphragm due to the large amount of
   fluid, c) paradoxical excursion of the inverted hemidiaphragm. Results:
   Simulations showed that during progressive pleural fluid withdrawal
   significant changes in the course of PPL were observed, particularly in
   scenarios b and c. Paradoxical excursion of the inverted hemidiaphragm
   significantly influenced the alveolar oxygen partial pressure (PAO2) due
   to a kind of pendelluft: e.g., air flows out from the corresponding lung
   during inspiration and thus it flows to the lung in the hemithorax
   without pleural effusion. Discussion: Flattening and inversion of the
   hemidiaphragm have an influence on several physiological factors of
   which PPL and PAO2 seem to be the most important. Hence, TT may improve
   pulmonary system function particularly in patients with inverted
   hemidiaphragm.
   Objectives: Bone loss at implantation sites on oral cavities is a major
   problem for dental surgeons; in order to combat this issue, we developed
   3 types of colagen biomaterial blends: chondrohitin sulfate, carbon
   nanotubes, and electric stimulated. Methods: Bovine colagen type I was
   dissoluted at 4\% in formic acid 0,1M (Synth - Brazil) and divided in 4
   groups: A- with Chondroitin Sulphate (Sigma Aldrich); B - carbon
   nanotubes suspention (Sigma Aldrich); C- eletric field ; D - control
   group. All of the samples were crosslinked with NHS
   (N-hydroxysuccinimide esters) (Thermo Scientific-USA) and freeze dried
   at a LH2000 equipment (Terroni - Brazil). The samples were analized by:
   SEM; EDS; XPS; Bartha respirometry and FET. Results: All of the samples
   have the same macroscopic morphology. The SEM of the group submitted to
   electric field shows organization of the colagen fibers. The EDS shows
   atomic content of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen with other substances
   Discussion: The absence of contaminants within the samples and the
   increase in stiffness exhibit the compatibility of this material for use
   in bone augmentation in implantology. The material is shown to be not
   toxic, however more tests should be conducted prior to human use.
   Objectives: The optimization of the long term storage of cells and
   tissues is a challenging process with many variables but one factor is
   often overlooked: the freezing device itself. There are freezing
   containers that have to be placed in a -80 degrees C freezer and the
   manufacturer promises a cooling rate of 1 K/min. On the other hand there
   are controlled rate freezers where cooling rates from 0.1 K/min up to 50
   K/min are promised. In this study we compared two commercially available
   freezing containers and four controlled rate freezers with respect to
   their functioning principle. Furthermore, we investigated the accuracy
   of the adjusted cooling rate and the nucleation temperature of the
   samples. Methods: Seven 1.5 ml cryovials filled with 1 ml 0.9\% (w/v)
   sodium chloride solution were dispersed evenly over the rack of each
   freezing device. Constantan thermocouples (type T) connected to a RedLab
   device were placed in the middle of the solution of each cryovial to
   record temperatures every second with the respective software. The
   cooling rates were calculated from the melting point (-0.6 degrees C) of
   the solution to -30 degrees C with n=3. For all freezing devices a
   cooling rate of 1 K/min was set according to the manufacturers
   guidelines. Results: The freezing containers had sample cooling rates
   between 0.5 and 0.8 K/min. All controlled rate freezers showed cooling
   rates similar to the programmed cooling rate of 1 K/min. Higher cooling
   rates resulted in increasing deviations between programmed and measured
   cooling rates. The nucleation temperatures of the samples in the
   freezing containers were mainly between 0 degrees C and -6 degrees C.
   However, the controlled rate freezers showed nucleation temperatures
   mainly in the range of -6 degrees C to -12 degrees C. Discussion:
   Varying definitions from each manufacturer resulted in the observed
   cooling rate differences of the freezing containers. Limited heat
   transfer accounted for the increased cooling rate deviation recorded in
   higher programmed cooling rates.
   Objectives: Patients using ventricular assist devices (VADs) still
   suffer from adverse events such as pump malfunctions or thromboembolic
   events. This can be caused by thrombi that have formed inside the pump
   (pump thrombus). Therefore, there is a great need to prevent such
   adverse events through engineering measures in the early development
   stage of blood pumps. Currently, a numerical model to predict thrombus
   sites inside VADs is still missing and the risk can only be assessed
   with in vitro experiments in the late development stage. A recently
   found model for thrombus formation at high shear rates that was derived
   from simple stenosis experiments promises great potential in the
   application in computational simulations (CFD) of VADs. Methods: In this
   study, advanced high resolution URANS simulations of rotational blood
   pumps were conducted with the flow solver of StarCCM+ (Siemens) at an
   operating point of 5L/min at 75 mmHg. A k- omega SST turbulence model
   and the sliding mesh method was applied. The existing model for
   predicting high shear thrombus formation was applied and compared with
   observations from explanted pumps. Based on these results a modification
   of that model is proposed that suggests a wall normal transport due to
   the change of shear rate in flow direction. This modification was
   realized in the CFD by applying a correlation between the computed
   direction of the pressure gradient and the flow direction. Results: The
   application of the model shows that thrombus sites are overpredicted in
   rotational blood pumps when compared with experimental results or
   observations from explanted pumps. However, with a modification of the
   model which proposes that the influence is a wall normal transport due
   to a change in shear rate, a good agreement was found. Discussion: Since
   there is little data available in the literature that shows the position
   of pump thrombi the validity of these models remains unclear and has to
   be experimentally evaluated further.
   Objectives: Cryptogenic stroke is the cause of 40\% of ischaemic acute
   cerebrovascular events. Study aim was to evaluate the recurrence of
   ischaemic cerebrovascular events in patients successfully treated by
   percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO). Methods: From
   February 2004 to January 2019, 314 symptomatic (243 stroke, 71 TIA)
   patients, (153 M 161 F; mean age 41 yrs, range 10-69) underwent
   percutaneous closure of PFO. 151 patients/314 (48\%) had concomitant
   migraine, 90 (60\%) with aura. 7 different occluder devices were
   implanted by transesophageal echocardiography, for a total of 317
   implants. During follow-up all patients underwent clinical (Rankin
   modified scale) and quality of life (SF36) evaluations, transcranial
   Doppler (TCD), trans-thoracic echocardiography, and MRI. Cerebral and
   angio-MR assessed the degree of lesions by quantitative and qualitative
   comparative analysis performed before and after treatment. Sizes of
   lesions were measured by manual segmentation on the axial, coronal and
   sagittal images acquired. Results: Successful device deployment was
   achieved in 99\% of pateints; patients were discharged home within 3
   days. Follow-up was 100\% complete (median 55.4, range 1-178 months). At
   6 months, Rankin scale was 0 (p<0.0001) in 230 patients (95\%) affected
   by stroke and 10 patients reached score 1. Quality of life improved
   significantly (P<0.0001). In 101/151 patients (67\%) with migraine,
   intensity and frequency of attacks significantly decreased (P<0.0001).
   TCD showed residual microembolic signals in 10 patients, 3 patients
   required secondary successful treatment for an associate defect. TTE
   (after 1, 3, 6, 12 months and once a year for 5 years) showed optimal
   sealing of all devices without signs of erosion, incomplete closure and
   thrombus. In 265 patients cerebral MRI showed no new lesions at 2 years.
   Discussion: Our 15 year experience suggests that percutaneous treatment
   of PFO is safe and beneficial for secondary prevention of recurrence of
   acute cerebrovascular events irrespective of the device used.
   Objectives: Endovascular stent grafting is the standard treatment for
   patients with acute traumatic aortic rupture with extensive associated
   lesions. Very little long term information is available in large series.
   Methods: From March 1999 to September 2018, 83 patients (72 M and 11 F;
   mean age: 37.25 +/- 13.46;range 16 to 69) admitted with acute or chronic
   traumatic aortic lesions underwent endovascular repair. 60 cases had
   acute traumatic aortic rupture, due to road accidents in 69 patients and
   accidental falls in 3 patients. All procedures were carried out in the
   angiography suite. Left subclavian artery was always identified.
   Patients were followed-up in the out-patient clinic and by yearly angio
   CT-scan with regard to survival and complications. The follow-up was
   100\% complete. Results: Endovascular stent-graft treatment was
   successful in all cases of acute or chronic aortic injury. No
   post-operative paraplegia occurred. Control angiography showed optimal
   sealing and complete exclusion of the pseudo-aneurysm from blood flow
   with no primary endoleak. Patients underwent treatment of all associated
   lesions later on during hospital stay. Two patients died in the
   hospital: 1 patient of cerebral haemorrhage and 1 patient of sepsis.
   During the follow-up 5 patients died (survival: 91.4\%) for causes
   unrelated to the aortic procedure. no cases of perigraft leakage or
   aortic disruption were detected. During follow-up 1 patient had a steal
   syndrome and 1 patient paraplegia due to the covering of the left
   subclavian artery by endovascular graft. 4 years after treatment 1
   patient had inner thrombosis of the graft developing a gradient; a new
   endovascular stent graft was deployed successfully. Freedom from
   complications was 92.3\%. Discussion: The outcomes over 20 years of
   follow-up proves that endovascular stent graft repair is the first
   choice treatment in patients with traumatic aortic injuries. Our
   experience demonstrates the feasibility and safety of endovascular
   treatment including patients with extensive associated injuries.
   Objectives: In vitro simulation of an in vivo environment for human stem
   cell research is crucial for any kind of biomedical purpose. While
   important factors like 3D-cultivation and physiological oxygen
   concentrations gain more attention in the scientific community, we still
   lack reliable methods to visualize the hypoxic response of cells in 2D
   and 3D in vitro systems. In this study we present human adipose-derived
   MSCs, modified with a genetically encoded hypoxia-sensor. Methods: We
   used a lentiviral system to stably integrate the genetic construct into
   the chromosomal DNA of mesenchymal stem cells. To investigate the
   features of this novel biosensor we cultivated our cells in a 2D- and
   3D-environment under various oxygen levels and evaluated the outset of
   biosensor-fluorescence via microscopy and flow cytometry. Results: The
   hypoxia sensor was successfully integrated in mesenchymal stem cells and
   could easily be induced by cultivating the cells in a hypoxic condition.
   MSCs, modified with hypoxia biosensors could be cultivated up to passage
   20. Trilineage differentiation of MSCs (adipogenous, osteogenous and
   chondrogenouse differentiation) was also preserved by the cells after
   transfection. Using these cells we could monitor which 3D-cultivation
   conditions lead to hypoxic response of MSCs. Discussion: Our findings
   can help to improve our understanding of the influence of cultivation
   conditions on in situ oxygen concentrations. Moreover, by choosing the
   right 3D cultivation system, MSC can be cultivated in vitro under
   physiological hypoxic conditions.
   Objectives: Heart failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) is a
   progressive disease with a low 5-year survival of <50\%, which affects
   23 million people worldwide. It is characterized by adverse remodeling
   of the left ventricle (dilated cardiomyopathy) due to an increase in
   filling pressures and myocardial wall stress. Pharmacological treatment
   and cardiac resynchronisation therapy have proven beneficial for
   survival. For patients with end-stage heart failure, a heart transplant
   or Left Ventricular Assist Device can be considered. A shortage of
   donors, patient selection and major downsides such as invasiveness and
   driveline infections limit the use of these treatments. Research has
   shown a 13\% decrease in mortality for every 5\% increase in left
   ventricular ejection fraction. Therefore, we developed a smart memory
   alloy configuration in order to increase the ejection fraction and
   obtain an increase of 3,5\% in a bench model. To cope with ongoing left
   ventricular dilatation and rise in wall stress, this should be combined
   with adjustable and measurable ventricular restraint therapy. Our first
   aim is to measure local wall stress during a full cardiac cycle. Next,
   we aim to develop a mathematical model of the left ventricle to
   characterize the left ventricle in HFrEF patients. Methods: We will
   characterize in vivo wall stresses during the full cardiac cycle using
   Transesophageal Echocardiography and a left ventricular pressure
   catheter in 10 patients undergoing cardiac surgery for heart failure.
   With these parameters, we will develop a simplified mathematical model
   of the left ventricle and we will improve our bench model for
   experimental testing. Results: This research will provide a
   characterization of the weakened left ventricular wall and the
   determination of optimal smart material properties and configuration of
   the cardiac assist device. Discussion: With this information, a
   patient-specific HFrEF treatment device will be developed combining
   active cardiac support and restraint therapy.
   Objectives: Clinical data on the hemocompatibility of membranes used in
   double filtration lipoprotein apheresis (LP) is virtually unavailable.
   The present trial compared the hemocompatibility of a recently
   introduced polyethersulfone (PES) based plasma fractionator membrane,
   FractioPES (R) 200, to an ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVAL)
   membrane during LP. Methods: In a prospective, randomized, controlled,
   crossover trial, eight patients on routine LP were subjected to one
   treatment with PES plasma (0.6 m(2), 3M PlasCure (R) 0.6) and
   fractionation (1.9 m(2), 3M SelectiCure (R) H19) membranes and one
   control treatment using a set of EVAL membranes (0.5 m(2), Asahi
   Plasmaflo OP-05W; 2.0 m(2), Asahi Cascadeflo EC-50W). Intraindividual
   treatment conditions were kept identical. At defined times, samples were
   drawn at different sites of the extracorporeal blood and plasma circuit
   to measure white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (PC) counts, complement
   factor C5a and thrombin-anti-thrombin III (ATIII). Results: With a nadir
   at 25 min, WBC in EVAL decreased to 34 \% of baseline vs. 64 \% at 20
   min in PES (P<0.001). PC only marginally decreased over time with both
   membrane types. Maximum C5a in venous blood was 30.0 +/- 11.2 mu g/L at
   30 min with EVAL and 14.0 +/- 12.8 mu g/L at 25 min with PES (P<0.001).
   Compared to PES (23.3 +/- 15.2 at 5 min and 16.9 +/- 12.3 at 20 min,
   resp.), highest C5a concentrations were found in plasma after the EVAL
   plasma (56.1 +/- 22.0 mu g/L at 10 min; P<0.001) and fractionation
   filters (50.6 +/- 19.4 mu g/L at 30 min; P<0.001). ATIII levels did not
   rise until the end of the treatment without differences between
   membranes. Regarding Lp(a), LDL and HDL removal, both membrane sets
   performed equally (PES, 69.8 +/- 5.7, 64.9 +/- 8.8, and 17.4 +/- 13.6
   \%, resp., vs. EVAL, 69.5 +/- 6.0, 65.2 +/- 6.9, and 18.2 +/- 7.3 \%,
   resp.). Discussion: Compared to EVAL, PES membranes are more beneficial
   with respect to the classical hemocompatibility of extracorporeal
   treatment procedures, namely leukocyte and complement system activation.
   Objectives: Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has become a standard
   therapy for adult end-stage heart failure patients. For pediatric
   patients, technological development lags behind with no currently
   approved implantable rotary blood pump. As an alternative, the HeartWare
   HVAD, originally designed for adults, is increasingly used in pediatric
   patients. The aim of this multicenter study was to assess in-silico,
   in-vitro and in-vivo the blood trauma potential of this pump in
   pediatric application. Methods: Blood trauma potential of the HVAD was
   investigated in-silico and in-vitro at an adult and pediatric operating
   point (5L/min and 2.5L/min at 2800rpm and 2200rpm, respectively). The
   flow was simulated by computational fluid dynamics and analyzed
   regarding flow structures, shear stresses and washout. Hemolysis was
   assessed with pumps circulating bovine blood in a temperate flow
   circuit. Clinical outcome and indicators for in-vivo blood trauma were
   investigated retrospectively in 14 pediatric HVAD patients (age 11.3 +/-
   4.8years). Results: In the pediatric conditions, simulations predicted
   elevated mechanical stress profile below 50mPa, more stagnant flow
   field, with longer washout times within the pump. In-vitro measurements
   revealed an increased normalized index of hemolysis (NIH = 17.5 mg/100L
   vs. 8.2 mg/100L, (p=0.0021)). In the retrospective in vivo analysis, LDH
   and D-Dimer values were 1.5 and 3-fold elevated, respectively, compared
   to adult HVAD patients. Major bleedings were observed in 42.9\%,
   suspected pump thrombosis and neurologic dysfunction in 14.3\% of all
   patients. Discussion: The HVAD, operated at lower speeds and flows,
   induces elevated blood trauma. These results highlight the need for
   specifically adapted ventricular assist devices, optimized for the
   pediatric population. Further studies are required to assess the
   clinical implications of these findings.
   Objectives: Native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular
   access for hemodialysis, but it still has high rate of failure due to
   stenosis formation. Convincing evidence supports a key role of local
   hemodynamics in vascular remodeling, suggesting that disturbed flow
   conditions may be related to stenosis development. The purpose of our
   investigation was to explore the feasibility of coupling non-contrast
   enhanced MRI and high-resolution computational fluid dynamics (HR-CFD)
   to relate morphological vessel changes to local hemodynamics in AVF over
   time. Methods: We acquired non-contrast enhanced 3D fast spin echo MRI
   (CUBE T1) at 1 and 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after radio-cephalic AVF
   creation in one patient. We generated 3D models and evaluated lumen
   cross-sectional area changes over time. We perfomed CFD simulations
   using pimpleFoam solver of OpenFoam, prescribing blood flow waveforms
   derived by Ultrasound examination. We computed the 2 components of the
   wall shear stress vector over time, namely WSSdir, the component in the
   mean direction of the WSS vector and WSStr, the transversal component.
   Results: We observed a dilatation of the vein until 6 months, with a
   more pronounced increase in the venous outflow as compared to the
   juxta-anastomotic vein (JAV). The increase in vein's diameter was then
   followed by a narrowing of JAV at 1 year after AVF surgery. We found
   high-frequency fluctuations both for WSSdir and WSStr components, in
   different locations of the vein, at 6 weeks and 6 months after AVF
   creation. Oscillations of both components damped at 1 year after AVF
   creation, as a result of vessel remodeling. Discussion: Optimized CUBE
   T1, coupled with HR-CFD, allowed a characterization of morphological and
   hemodynamic changes over time. Our MRI-to-CFD pipeline represents a
   promising approach to elucidate mechanisms of local vascular remodeling
   and can be used for clinical investigations aimed at identifying
   critical hemodynamic factors responsible for AVF failure.
   Objectives: For 30 years, the mortality rate of patients hospitalized in
   intensive care unit has been drastically reduced. But an increase in
   muscle dysfunctions at the end of intensive care stay, leading to long
   term functional disability was observed at the same time. The
   physiological mechanism remains poorly understood due to a lack of study
   tools. The objective of this work is therefore to create a new tool for
   the tissue construction of an in vitro skeletal muscle. This tool should
   allow a muscle construction which mimics physiological reality, in order
   to model the disease more accurately. Also, it should allow mechanical
   and electrical stimulation in order to simulate the resumption of muscle
   contraction of patients. Methods: Using sol-gel process, we synthesized
   a new biomaterial, based on an epoxy organic-inorganic hybrid precursor
   (g-glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane). This biomaterial was deposited as
   a thin layer (spin-coating process) of 7 mu m thickness on a silicone
   membrane suitable to undergo mechanical stretching. The biomaterial was
   microstructured using the UV laser writing lithography to create a line
   network. This line network was revealed with a 2-minute isopropanol bath
   and we obtained lines of 8 mu m thickness spaced of 175 mu m. To ensure
   a biological environment and a strong adhesion of cells on
   microstructured silicone support during mechanical stretching, we
   grafted silylated bioactive peptides using dip-coating process. Results:
   Muscular stem cells which were isolated from patients' quadriceps biopsy
   were seemed and, by immunofluorescence staining, we observed a growth of
   muscle fibers along the lines, mimicking the physiological organization
   of a muscle. Discussion: We were able to model the first stages of a
   complex muscle organoid in vitro using a new tool manufactured by a
   fast, simple and reproducible process. With the mechanical and
   electrical stimulation of this muscle-on-a-chip, this work should allow
   us to better understand these muscle dysfunctions and find new
   treatments.
   Objectives: Cryopreservation of `ready-to-use' tissue-engineered
   constructs (TECs) is a promising strategy which may facilitate their
   future clinical application. This is very challenging and ambitious task
   and therefore recent efforts have been focused on developing new
   cryopreservation strategies for long-term storage of TECs. This work
   covers some practical considerations for cryopreservation of cell-free
   and cell-seeded scaffolds vastly differing by structure and composition.
   Methods: The first test system includes 3D porous
   collagen-hydroxyapatite (HAP) scaffolds prepared by freeze-drying and
   coaxial alginate macrospheres prepared by electrospraying. Samples were
   frozen at 1 K/min either in a bulk DMSO solution (with and without
   sucrose) or after removal of residual solution. After thawing, we
   evaluated compression (collagen-HAP scaffolds) and rheological
   properties (coaxial alginate macrospheres) of cell-free systems.
   Viability of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) within both types of
   scaffolds was evaluated 24-h post-thaw using live-dead assay. The second
   test system comprises flat fiber mats (produced from
   polycaprolactone/polylactic acid using electrospinning) seeded with CHO
   cells. This system intends to develop plate electrodes for
   electroporation of attached cells with non-permeable cryoprotective
   agents (CPAs) such as sugars for future cryopreservation applications.
   Results: All scaffolds were cytocompatible with corresponding cell
   types. Freezing after removal of residual solution was superior to
   conventional freezing. Addition of sucrose increased cell viability
   (both scaffold types) and improved viscoelastic properties of coaxial
   macrospheres. Constructed plate electrodes provided good compromise
   between high cell permeabilisation and viability after electroporation
   with sucrose at 1.7 kV/cm electric field. Discussion: The findings
   suggest that it is feasible to cryopreserve cell-free and cell-seeded
   scaffolds using DMSO and sucrose. As a step further, there are high
   expectations associated with using electroporation as a mean for
   intracellular delivery of non-toxic CPAs towards DMSO-free
   cryopreservation of TECs.
   Objectives: Tailored Forming is a new manufacturing technology to
   manufacture solid components out of two or more different metals. The
   components are joined to a hybrid semi-finished workpiece. Afterwards, a
   forming process is performed to improve the materials properties. This
   allows creating hybrid metallic parts that are adjusted to their
   specific loads and their field of application in comparison to parts
   made out of monomaterials. The potential use case of Tailored
   Forming-parts is still being researched. Biomedical implants are a
   potential field of application. In the presented study, the contact
   mechanics of two potential concepts for Tailored Forming hip implants
   were analysed. Methods: Both concepts consist of a magnesium component
   that should be resorbed in the human body and leads to a better bone
   growth. A second component in the implants is used to absorb loads. In a
   numerical analysis the two implants were compared to a conventional
   implant. For the potential evaluation two load cases ``walking{''} and
   ``walking upstairs{''} were considered. Results: While one concept leads
   to higher stresses in the implant, the other concept shows almost
   similar stress distributions as the conventional implant and has the
   additional advantage of the better bone growth due to the magnesium
   component. Discussion: Based on this work further research on different
   implant concepts has to be made to give a clear statement about the
   potential of Tailored Forming-Implants.
   Objectives: In consideration of the recently published implant files,
   testing of medical devices has gained signifigant importance. Many
   medical implants are subject to normative testing during their
   regulatory approval process, such as stents, heart valves and blood
   pumps. No testing norm or standard, however, exists for regulatory
   approval of left atrial appendage occlusion devices. Therefore, this
   study aimed to establish in-vitro bench tests for LAA occlusion (LAAo)
   devices and compares the clinically most widely used devices. Methods:
   Seven different LAA occlusion systems with device diameter ranging
   between 22 and 34 mm were tested regarding tug force and radial force
   resulting in a total of 24 devices. Radial force was assessed in a
   commercially available tester whereas tug force was evaluated in a novel
   in-vitro test setup consisting of bovine tissue. Results: Significant
   differences in the mechanical properties of the different devices were
   observed. Radial force ranged between 8.6 N at maximum compression for
   the LAmbre 2228 device and 0.1 N for the Occlutech 27 mm implant at
   minimum compression. A similar variability of mechanical properties was
   seen in the tug test results. Values ranged from 4.6 N to 0.4 N for the
   Wavecrest 22 mm and the Occlutech 24 mm device, respectively, at maximum
   and minimum compression. Discussion: Large variations in mechanical
   properties were seen between the different devices. The study showed
   that device stability is more dependent on anchoring structures, such as
   hooks and barbs, than on radial force. A strong positive correlation
   between the number of anchoring structures per millimeter circumference
   of an occluder and its tug force was found (r=0.87, p < 0.01). The large
   variations in mechanical properties aggravate comparison of current LAA
   occlusion devices which underlines the need for standardized preclinical
   testing to prompt clinical compatibility.
   Objectives: Pump thrombosis is a severe adverse event in ventricular
   assist devices. Current therapy often involves an exchange of the entire
   pump. Alternative solutions must be explored to reduce surgery numbers.
   A protocol for in vitro lysis of LVAD specific thrombus with alteplase
   was established in this study. Methods: A fluid chamber of silicone
   tubing was filled with isotonic sodium chloride solution. An artificial
   human thrombus was suspended within. Alteplase was added to the system
   according to the maximum dose for clinical use, 0.028 mg/ml. Five
   experiments each were conducted for stasis and fibrin thrombi
   respectively. Both types were lysis tested for four and 24 hours each.
   Fluid samples and photographs were taken for dissolution evaluation.
   Results: Visual inspection of the fibrin thrombus showed clear
   dissolution. For the stasis thrombus, the 24 h experiment produced no
   discernible dissolution of the thrombi, while the thrombi investigated
   over the 4 h period fragmented into small pieces which did not dissolve
   entirely. D-dimer levels in the fibrin thrombus tests rose steadily
   through the alteplase treatment for both test durations (short test
   12800-25600 ng/ml, long test 25600-51200 ng/ml). For the short term
   stasis thrombus testing, D-dimer values rose similarly to the fibrin
   thrombus, but levels remained much lower (short test 1600-3200 ng/ml,
   long test >200 ng/ml). Long term stasis thrombus tests showed no
   significant rise in D-dimer levels. Discussion: Alteplase was successful
   in dissolving fibrin thrombi in our experimental setup. D-dimer analysis
   supported the visual impression. The fragmentation of stasis thrombi and
   D-dimer levels measured may be due to the drug's fibrinolytic effect.
   The amount of erythrocytes in a stasis thrombus may resist lysis and
   produce challenges in the clinical application of thrombus lysis
   treatment. With this setup we were able to examine the reaction of the
   LVAD thrombi to Alteplase. This information can be used to further
   optimise clinical lysis therapy.
   Objectives: Methylprednisolon pulse therapy was used in the initial
   phase of induction therapy in some patients. This study was conducted in
   order to examine the short and long term effect of methylprednisolone
   pulse therapy for the lupus nephritis treated with muti-target therapy.
   Methods: The retrospective study included 43 patients diagnosed with
   lupus nephritis receiving muti-target therapy in our center, including
   prednisone combined with MMF and tacrolimus. 19 patients received
   methylprednisolon pulse therapy in the initial phase of induction
   therapy, 24 patients only received prednisone combined with MMF and
   tacrolimus. The dose of methylprednisolonpulse therapy was intravenous
   injection 500mgx3 days and the following prednisone dose was
   0.8-1.0mg/kg. We compared the primary and secondary outcomes of the two
   groups. In the patients combined with acute renal injury (AKI) subgroup,
   we also compared the primary and secondary outcomes between the two
   groups. Results: In the primary outcome, the CR rates are similar
   between the two groups. We did not find significant difference in the
   total remission rate (either complete or partial) between the two groups
   (p=0.93). The same is true for the remission time (p=0.87). There was no
   significant difference in the time and number of patients entering
   hemodialysis between the two groups (p=0.65). Although, in the AKI
   subgroup, there was a significant difference in the serum creatinine
   between the two groups in 1 month (P=0.045). However, there was no
   significant difference in the following up, and the probability of
   achieving CR and replase (calculated by using the Kaplan - Meier method)
   also had no significant difference. Discussion: Methylprednisolon pulse
   therapy seemed to have no significant effect on the long-term prognosis
   of lupus nephritis treated with muti-target therapy and it could not
   delay the patients' entry into hemodialysis. However, it may have had a
   better effect on the recovery of AKI patients and rapid relief of
   inflammatory reactions.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate intradialytic on-line
   multicomponent total removed solutes (TRS) monitoring in the spent
   dialysate, as potentially more objective parameter for removal of uremic
   solute markers urea, indoxyl sulfate (IS), and beta 2-Microglobulin
   (B2M) compared to relative indices as removal ratio, using a novel
   miniaturized optical sensor during hemodialysis (HD) and
   hemodiafiltration (HDF) with different settings. Methods: Ten ESKD
   patients (6 M and 4 F, 60.2 +/- 16.8 yrs) on chronic HDF were followed
   during 5 midweek dialysis sessions each (length 240min, HD: N=1,
   Qb=200ml/min, Qd=300ml/min, FX60; HDF: N=4, Qb > 300ml/min, Qd >
   500ml/min, Vsubst > 15l, FX800 and FX1000). Spent dialysate from the
   drain was monitored on-line by a miniaturized sensor prototype
   (Optofluid Technologies Ou, Estonia). For total dialysate collection
   method as the reference, a spent dialysate sample from the tank at the
   end of each dialysis session was taken. The concentrations of urea and
   B2M were determined in the clinical laboratory. Concentration of IS was
   determined utilizing the HPLC. Based on differences between laboratory
   and optical sensor TRS values BIAS and standard error (SE) were
   calculated. A t-test was used to determine significant differences (P <=
   0.05). Results: The average TRS values of optical sensor and laboratory
   were 510 +/- 86mM/L and 485 +/- 106mM/L for urea, 224 +/- 41mg/L and 228
   +/- 47mg/L for B2M, and 732 +/- 371 mu M/L and 719 +/- 392 mu M/L for
   IS, respectively. No statistical differences were found between optical
   and laboratory TRS values for any uremic solute. The relative BIAS +/-
   SE values of the TRS were -7.99 +/- 19.43\% for urea, 0.07 +/- 15.60\%
   for B2M, and -4.72 +/- 13.25\% for IS, respectively. Discussion: Novel
   miniaturized optical sensor successfully carried out intradialytic
   on-line multicomponent TRS monitoring in the spent dialysate.
   Objectives: Perioperative tight glycemic control (TGC) and management is
   of paramount importance during perioperative treatment of patients with
   multiorgan failure. Recent results have shown that such interoperative
   TGC led to an improvement of morbidity and mortality and to a prevention
   of Surgical site infection (SSI) in ICU patients. Consequently, a
   user-friendly device combining glucose analysis and delivery of glucose
   and insulin should allow for better therapies. Methods: Based on an
   already existing artificial pancreas device (STG-22), a new artificial
   endocrine pancreas system (STG-55) was developed. With a battery
   incorporated, it uses again a closed loop analytical system. Due to its
   in-built sensors, the closed-loop system allows for a quick and easy
   feed-back analysis of patient data through already established
   algorithms for glucose and insulin infusion. With the help of a
   disposable modular tubing circuit blood sampling from the patient's vein
   is realized and assessed by an automatically calibrated sensor. The
   device exhibits a maneuverable weight of only 36 kg and can be set-up
   within a single hour. Results: Clinical trials with STG-55, in Japan
   (Kochi University Hospital) have proven its re not sign liable
   practicability. Glucose monitoring was stable and results comparable to
   the analyses of an independent glucose analyzer with a high correlation
   coefficient. Due to appropriate insulin administration, no hypoglycemia
   was observed in patients under investigation. Discussion: The advent of
   new technological tools, such as miniaturized analytical devices in
   combination with the application of patient-specific precise algorithms
   allows for a strict and successful therapy without hypoglycemia in
   perioperative patients. With the new design and concept of STG-55, the
   set-up time for the artificial pancreas can be reduced down to 30\% of
   preexisting devices, which finally makes a glucose and insulin
   management in both the interoperative and the ICU user friendly.
   The generation of complex cellular structures for human application
   often requires a matrix, defining the three-dimensional shape and
   mechanical properties of the artificial tissue. The matrix as such is
   not viable. If this matrix is of human origin, Directive 2004/23/EC (in
   its national version) shall apply. In that case only
   ``non-substantial{''} processing methods may be utilized, which are
   specified in Regulation 1294/2007/EC. For example, non-cellular
   substances can be extracted from the tissue, so-called derivatives.
   These derivatives, if of human origin, are also tissues within the
   meaning of Directive 2004/23/EC. If these derivatives are further
   processed, or if the tissue originates from animals, the matrix is
   classified as a medical device. The Human Tissue Authority describes the
   delimitation as follows: ``Derivatives of non-viable tissues and cells
   such collagen fillers (i.e. collagen extracted from tissues and cells)
   fall under the Medical Device Regulation (MDR). Non-viable tissue and
   cell products such as demineralized bone matrix, or acellular human
   tissues or tissue matrices, will not be covered by the MDR. They will
   continue to fall under the Directive 2004/23/EC.{''} The paper deals in
   more detail with the problem of demarcation and describes the
   consequences of this in practice. We will discuss the problem of
   demarcation in more detail as well as describe the consequences in
   practical implementation.
   Objectives: In this study, two attempts of new biomaterial development
   based on the latest results of cell biology and tissue engineering are
   reported. One is specific cell separation using DNA as linker, and
   another is novel hybrid materials constructed by decellularized tissues
   complexed with synthetic polymer. Methods: Antibody was immobilized via
   desthiobiotin-avidin interaction. Single strand DNA (20mer) was
   chemically immobilized on the surface and then antibody (anti-mouse
   CD45, mCD45) modified with the complementary single strand DNA was
   immobilized on the surface through DNA duplex formation. Decellularized
   porcine dermis was prepared and lyophilized. After that, methyl
   methacrylate (MMA) monomer were immersed in stages, then polymerization
   was proceeded. The obtained hybrid material was analyzed by tensile
   strength and SEM observation. Results: Cells were also adhered on the
   surface at 37 degrees C and detached by 4 degrees C incubation with
   remaining cells that interacted with the surface via antibody-antigen
   interaction. The adhered cells were released by DNase treatment. These
   results suggest that cells can be selectively captured and collected by
   using the surface that immobilizes an antibody via dissociation
   molecules. The monomer absorption depends strongly on the tissue
   structure. Gradient-type decellularized dermis-poly(methyl methacrylate)
   complex was prepared by controlling the permeation time of the methyl
   methacrylate monomer. The mechanical strength of this complex gradually
   increased from the dermis side to the polymer side. Discussion:
   Developing new biomaterials combining new knowledge among different
   science discipline is an indispensable methodology for the next
   generation of medical development. The materials presented here are
   example of these biomaterials, and show the direction of future
   biomaterial development.
   Objectives: This investigation discusses the method of electrical
   stimulation of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)
   and skin fibroblasts (FB) growing on substrates composed by carbon
   nanotubes and organic compounds. Methods: Substrates were produced from
   a water dispersion of single-walled carbon nanotubes and organic
   compounds (serum albumin, collagen, chitosan) and formed by evaporation
   of the liquid component using infrared laser radiation. Laser exposure
   stimulated the formation of conductive nanotube clusters responsible for
   electrical signal transmission to the cells, and organic compounds
   improved cell adhesion due to the presence of cell membrane receptors
   sensitive to matrix proteins and aminosugar molecules. An aseptic system
   for electrical cell stimulation included an electric pulse generator,
   culture plate with cells with a breadboard and electrodes made of
   surgical steel with gold plating. Cells were stimulated for 48 hours
   with pulsed electric signal (60-200 mV amplitude, 1 ms pulse duration, 1
   s pause) directly inside the CO2-incubator. Results: The effects of
   electrical stimulation on the cell proliferation were estimated by
   MTT-test. It was found that both MSC and FB are sensitive to the
   stimulus, but the most prominent increase of cell proliferation was
   detected at 80 mV pulse amplitude. In these conditions, a 13 and 16
   percent augmentation of cell growth rate was obtained for MSC and FB,
   respectively. Similar results (the formation of denser cell monolayer)
   were achieved by fluorescent microscopy of cell nuclei stained by
   ethidium bromide and fluorescein diacetate. No pathological changes in
   cell morphology were observed. Discussion: The obtained results suggest
   that MSC and FB growing on conductive substrates are sensitive to
   electrical stimulation. This observation can be explained by the
   activation of potential-controlled ion channels and the stimulation of
   metabolic processes that accelerate cell growth.
   Objectives: The Modular Extracorporeal Lung Assist System (ModELAS) is a
   highly compact, modular, fully integrated pump-lung. The device can be
   configured to provide adult low-flow extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R)
   (removal of 30-50\% of metabolic CO2), full adult respiratory support or
   full pediatric respiratory support. The modular design allows for the
   exchange of the 0.65 m(2) adult bundle and the 0.3 m(2) pediatric
   bundle, while all other device components are identical. These studies
   characterized the in vivo performance of the ModELAS for each
   application. Methods: In vivo device performance was evaluated in
   healthy sheep (n=4 7-day ECCO2R, n=6 30-day adult ECMO, n=3 7-day
   pediatric ECMO). Pediatric studies utilized a right atrium to pulmonary
   artery cannulation strategy while adult studies utilized a dual lumen
   cannula placed in the jugular vein. Animals were recovered and tethered
   within a pen. The target blood flow rate was 0.5 L/min for ECCO2R and
   2-3 L/min for the ECMO applications. Anticoagulation was achieved via
   continuous heparin infusion. Animal hemodynamics were measured hourly,
   and blood chemistry, gas transfer and plasma free hemoglobin (PfHb) were
   measured throughout each study. Results: All animals were recovered and
   9 animals completed the full study duration. Average CO2 removal during
   ECCO2R was 74 +/- 6 mL/min. Average adult and pediatric oxygenation was
   134 +/- 10 mL/min and 94 +/- 11 mL/min, respectively. Average PfHb was
   less than 25 mg/dL, with the exception of one study following an acute
   kidney injury. Early terminations were due to a pulmonary embolism, a
   hemothorax, an intra-bundle thrombus and a fractured cannula. Typical
   explanted devices exhibited minimal thrombus. When present, thrombi were
   primarily located at the bundle inlet surface and impeller pivot.
   Discussion: These studies are on-going, but demonstrate positive
   performance of the ModELAS across a clinically relevant respiratory
   support spectrum.
   Objectives: Various modes of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with or
   without a pump have been used as a bridge to lung transplantation in
   clinical settings. We have started to develop a large animal model for
   testing newly developed artificial lungs that can be used as a long-term
   bridging device. Methods: A total of eight goats weighing 40-55 kg were
   used. A membrane lung (Capiox EBS (R), Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) accompanied
   by a centrifugal pump (Emersave (R), Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was connected
   to the pulmonary artery (PA) trunk for outflow, and the left atrial (LA)
   appendage for inflow. The PA pressure (PAP), systemic arterial pressure
   (AP), pre- and post-oxygenator pressures were monitored. The blood flow
   of the main PA and the membrane lung were monitored continuously by
   using an ultrasonic perivascular probe (Transonic Systems Inc., Ithaca,
   NY). The blood flow to the membrane lung was maintained at around 2.0
   L/min during the trials. Results: Four out of eight goats did not
   survive because of initial surgical failures (N=2), and introducing air
   bubbles in the membrane lungs (N=2). Other four goats were successfully
   kept for device testing. Durations of the circuit run were 7, 16, 24,
   and 48 days with or without heparin infusions according to the
   experimental protocols. Mean AP and mean PAP at the recovery from the
   surgery were 81 +/- 16 mmHg and 19 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively. The PA flow
   rate was 4.4 +/- 0.5 L/min. Discussion: The animal model for testing
   long-term membrane lung application as PA-to-LA configuration has been
   established. The model makes it possible for us to assess artificial
   lungs in vivo setting for long-term with stable blood flow through the
   device.
   Objectives: The effectiveness of the inhaled drugs is strictly related
   to the areas which are reachable by the drug particles. Unless the
   particles reach the desired part of the bronchial tree, their influence
   might not meet the required expectations and consequently the disease
   progress might not be stopped. Therefore, the primary objective of this
   research was to analyze the airflow patterns and particles deposition of
   a standard inhaled drug, commonly used during the treatment of asthma,
   with the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The study was
   devoted to the analysis of the particles diameter influence on their
   deposition areas within the entire respiratory tract. Methods: Two
   patient-specific respiratory tract models, for 6 and 12-year-old
   patients, were reconstructed basing on the DICOM image sets obtained
   during the Computed Tomography Examinations. The reconstruction of the
   digital models was performed within the Mimics Research 20.0 program,
   whereas the meshes were prepared with the use of the Ansys ICEM package.
   Numerical analyses were carried out as stationary ones with the constant
   inflow of the particles of various diameters (within the range of
   1.0-50.0 mu m). Results: It was proven that depending on the particles
   size, their deposition within the respiratory tract varies
   significantly. The vast majority of the particles with diameters over 20
   mu m are gathered on the walls of the throat, whereas particles of
   diameters 5-15 mu m are accumulating mainly on the trachea walls,
   leaving the alveoli insufficiently supplied with the drug particles.
   Similar phenomena could be observed for both investigated cases of the
   reconstructed geometries. Discussion: The significant changes of the
   drug particle distribution resulting from the various diameters of the
   particles indicate that the inhaled drug size cannot be treated as
   negligible factor during the drug spraying. Improper distribution of the
   particles, i.e. their aggregation on the wall of the throat and trachea,
   might not inhibit the symptoms of the asthma.
   Objectives: The improvement of immunosuppressive strategies have
   signifigantly reduced the risk and mortality of cellular rejection after
   Heart Transplantation (HTx). Recently, Humoral Rejection and antibodies
   have been recognized as a major problem in the management of recipients
   during the follow-up. Methods: 23 patients out of more than 700
   recipients undergoing HTx and 6 undergoing retransplantation required
   techniques of apheretic medicine to manage Humoral Rejection episodes or
   to lead to transplant patients with Donor Specific Antibodies (DSA).
   Results: In our experience 4 patients were treated with photopheresis
   with excellent tolerability, no adverse event and no rejection episodes.
   Photopheresis was added on top of standard immunosuppressive therapy in
   patients requiring minimization of calcineurins due to other clinical
   conditions. 19 patients experiencing humoral rejection were treated
   alternatively with Plasma Exchange (8 patients) or with
   immunoadsorption. Plasma Exchange was preferred in acute patients
   requiring removal of inflammatory factors other than antibodies while
   Immunoabsorption was better tolerated and adopted to reduce the
   metabolic impact and coagulative disorders when the patient was more
   stable. Discussion: Apheretic Medicine has opened a new door and
   represents an efficient weapon in the armamentarium of an HTx center.
   The complexity of the management of this new diseased in frail patients
   highlights the need for a multidisciplinary group establishing the right
   treatment for every patient.
   Realheart TAH is designed to imitate the construction of the human heart
   in order to create a blood flow as natural as possible. Realheart TAH
   consists of two pumps, corresponding to the right and left side of the
   natural heart. It pumps blood from the left side and right side
   simultaneously in a synchronized manner. Each pump of the Realheart TAH
   consists of an atrium and a ventricle, with a valve cylinder in between.
   When the valve cylinder moves towards ventricle, the blood pumps out
   from the ventricle creating the systolic phase. The ventricle fills with
   blood when the valve cylinder moves towards the atrium creating a
   diastolic phase. The cardiac output of the Realheart TAH depends on the
   stroke length of the valve cylinder and the frequency of the movement.
   The left and right pump regulate cardiac output independently in order
   to coordinate the left/right flow balance of the circulatory system.
   Similar to natural heart, Realheart TAH is integrated into the
   circulatory system, which facilitates the uninterrupted blood flow to
   the atrium, when it pumps the blood out of the ventricle in pulses. The
   atrium is constructed with a compliance membrane to avoid blood suction
   from the veins during the systolic phase.
   Objectives: Pre-vascularized, fibrin-based implants that can be attached
   to the blood vessels in vivo are a promising solution to faster and more
   efficient vascularization of implants, to facilitate implant healing and
   survival. Here, low concentrated (up to 10mg/mL) fibrin hydrogels have
   been shown to promote tube formation of endothelial cells in co-culture
   with ASC. However, these fibrin hydrogels are fairly unstable and higher
   fibrin concentrations are necessary for implant fabrication. We
   investigated whether higher concentrated (20-40 mg/mL) fibrin hydrogels
   were suitable for tube formation and if perfusion of the hydrogels could
   support capillarization of a fibrin-based implant. Methods: Capillary
   formation of endothelial cells was tested in tube assays using fibrin
   concentrations of 1-30 mg/ml. Hydrogels were fabricated with
   cryoprecipitated fibrinogen from blood plasma that had been activated
   with thrombin. Gels were seeded with EC and ASC co-cultures, supplied
   with feeding medium containing pro-angiogenic factors, and cultivated
   for 7 days. Hydrogels with 40 mg/mL fibrin and pre-formed channels were
   cellularized with EC and ASC and perfused with feeding medium for 10
   days under continuous flow. Results: In tube assays, only concentrations
   of 1 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL fibrin were suitable for endothelial tube
   formation, which started after 2 days and peaked after 5 days in
   culture. Tubes were stable for the total assay duration of 7 days.
   However, under perfusion, fibrin gels of 40 mg/mL showed an
   endothelialized pore formation throughout the gel. Discussion:
   High-concentration fibrin hydrogels can successfully be capillarized by
   EC-ASC co-cultures and perfusion. In static conditions, only
   low-concentration fibrin hydrogels are suitable for tube formation. As
   the next step hydrogels of different concentrations are to be connected
   to fibrin vascular grafts and perfused as a whole implant construct
   using a custom-made flow chamber as mechanical support.
   Objectives: The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of the
   passage number and glucose concentration on viability of the human
   umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) cultured in the culture flasks.
   Methods: The HUVEC were isolated from umbilical veins obtained by
   Caesarean section. Cells after the 2nd and 7th passage were seeded with
   density of 4,600 cells/cm2. Glucose concentration in the culture medium
   was kept constant at the normal (5 mM) or high (20 mM) level or was
   switched every 24 hours from normal to high level or vice versa for 7 or
   14 days. The cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi
   m) and activity of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) were analyzed using
   the flow cytometry (with propidium iodide, JC1 and DCFDA test,
   respectively). The glucose uptake and lactate production was also
   monitored. Microscopic visualization of cells was made after fixation in
   formalin using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Results: After 7 days of
   culturing in medium with normal, high and variable glucose concentration
   the cell viability was higher respectively by 5\%, 4\% and 4\% in the
   HUVEC passaged 7 times than in those passaged 2 times. After 14 days the
   differences were higher and equal to 21\%, 21\% and 31\%, respectively.
   After 7 days Delta psi m was higher 1.3, 3.2 and 2.6 times in HUVEC
   after 7th passage than those after 2nd one, which were cultured in
   medium with the normal, high and variable glucose level, respectively.
   The glucose uptake and the lactate production were higher after 14 days
   and similar for all passages. The ROS activity was lower after 14 days
   of culturing for all cultures. Microscopic visualization of cells did
   not show any morphological differences. Discussion: The obtained results
   show that the properties and phenotype of HUVEC after the second passage
   are closer to the properties and phenotype of native cells. The HUVEC
   after the 7th passage are better adapted to in vitro conditions
   deviating from physiological conditions.
   One of the pillars for a more patient oriented healthcare is found in
   patient individualised medicine. Custom-made implants tailored to the
   individual's specific requirements is one of the key elements herein to
   obtain better outcomes. However, the production of patient
   individualised implants is nowadays still often related to a high rate
   of manual processes, causing both high cost and long delivery periods.
   Technical innovations play a crucial role in introducing these patient
   individualised therapy options into clinical prac-tice. Advances in
   medical imaging and the evolution of new production technologies (e.g.
   additive manufacturing) build the basis for a time and cost effective
   production of implants of lot size one at industrial-scale level.
   Combining these aspects with digitalisation leads to the potential of a
   new era of patient individualised implants and appropriate business
   models. It is crucial to systematically review and adapt the data
   management and data processing throughout the entire value chain in
   order to achieve the goal of a more patient individualised care.
   Different tools are used to de-fine interfaces, actors, data types
   throughout the entire process and methods need to be established for the
   data pro-cessing itself. A digital process chain from diagnosis to the
   actual delivery of a custom-made implant to the hospital including the
   manufacturing process is established. The underlying principles and
   assumptions used are exemplarily shown. The digital process chain is
   used to pave the way from science into a successful business model and
   company, in order to introduce these patient individualised implants to
   achieve a better patient care. The use of technical and medical
   progresses in combination with digitalisation is used to obtain a new
   generation of patient individualised implants. The way from science to
   start-up within this field is presented.
   Objectives: There are currently no available noninvasive methods that
   allow for the simultaneous and reliable measure of cardiac output (CO)
   and pulse wave velocity (PWV) in the arterial tree. Both of those
   indices are important biomarkers of cardiovascular status. Methods:
   Radial pressure profiles were recorded using applanation tonometry in a
   group of healthy subjects (N=18) and hemodialysis patients (N=30).
   Recorded pulse waves were used to estimate patient-specific parameters
   of the mathematical model describing the blood flow in the system of 55
   major arteries. Calibration of the model with patient data allowed to
   calculate patient-specific CO and PWV between any two points in the
   arterial tree. In all of the patients and healthy subjects we performed
   additional measurements of PWV using ECG gated applanation tonometry at
   two arterial sites (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical) and CO using bioimpedance
   cardiography (PhysioFlow, Manatec Biomedical). Results: The model was
   able to reproduce all of the recorded pressure profiles with high
   accuracy (average relative error < 10\%). Model-estimated PWV highly
   correlated with the one measured using SphygmoCor device (R = 0.75,
   p-value < 0.001). Model-predicted CO also correlated with the one
   measured by the bioimpedance cardiography, but at a lower level (R =
   0.52, p-value <0.001). Discussion: Our study demonstrates that coupling
   a mathematical model with a single peripheral pressure profile has the
   potential to provide information about cardiovascular state that was
   previously only available when using more complicated methods.
   Objectives: The purpose of this work is the study of biocompatibility
   for samples of three-dimensional cellular and tissue engineering
   constructions for layer-by-layer repair of tissues of heart and blood
   vessels. Samples components are albumin, collagen and chitosan as
   matrices and carbon nanotubes as reinforcement. Three-dimensional
   structures are formed in layers by laser printing. Methods: The
   biocompatibility of the samples and layers of their components was
   evaluated after their incubation with endothelial cells for 72 hours.
   Cell morphology was assessed by fluorescence microscopy and quantitative
   analysis was performed using MTT-test and real-time cell analysis by
   means of electrical impedance monitoring. For in vivo studies, samples
   were implanted in breasts of laboratory birds. Results: It has been
   established that the layer consisting of albumin and nanotubes supports
   proliferation of cells the most. Moreover, all layers have surface
   properties that provide cell adhesion. Real-time cell analysis showed
   improved cell proliferation compared to control during the entire
   incubation time, however the greatest differences were observed after 25
   hours of incubation. The morphology of the cells on the samples
   corresponds to the morphology of the control cells. With implantation of
   samples in experimental animals, the absence of their toxicity was
   observed. Discussion: Samples of three-dimensional cellular and
   tissue-engineering structures are biocompatible because of
   characteristics of their components and suitable surface structure. The
   obtained samples can be used to repair damages in cardiovascular system.
   Due to the method of laser printing, samples can be made in any form,
   taking into account the features of the damaged area of tissues.
   Objectives: The blood flow rate is the only parameter that can be
   controlled during the operation of an intracorporeal membrane oxygenator
   that significantly influences the gas exchange rate. Due to anatomical
   size restrictions, the catheter is of limited size and the tight
   packaging does not allow for placement of a dedicated flow rate sensor.
   Therefore, for a flow rate control system, the correct estimation of the
   blood flow rate is essential. In this work, a system specific flow rate
   estimation method is presented based on motor current and motor speed
   measurements. Methods: A training data set of motor current - I and
   rotational speed - omega, as well as volumetric flow rate - Q were
   recorded in an in-vitro model of the intracorporeal membrane oxygenator.
   A 40/60 water/glycerol mixture was used to approximate the dynamic
   properties of blood. The rotational speed of the motor was varied in a
   range of 10000 to 30000 RPM. For each motor speed, the hydraulic
   resistance of the system was varied with a throttle resulting in
   different flow rate values. Additionally, a test data set was acquired
   consisting of different rotational speed, hydraulic resistance, and flow
   rate triplets. The I, omega and Q training data was used to construct a
   fitting surface of the type Q(I, omega) by a regularized cubic spline
   least-squares approximation method. The surface was defined in a grid of
   591x591 points with Imin=-70 mA, Imax=520 mA, omega min=500 RPM, omega
   max=30000 RPM. The test set of I - omega pairs was then used to predict
   Q by means of a nearest neighbor search in the modeled surface. Results:
   A correlation coefficient of r=0.96 was achieved between the estimated
   and measured flow rates of the water/glycerol mixture. Discussion: The
   strong correlation between estimated and measured flow rate suggests
   that sensorless flow rate control is possible.
   Objectives: Developing new bioinks that are able to meet the crucial
   requirements for 3D bioprinting of different tissues has emerged
   recently as an important topic in the field of biomaterials. In this
   work, linear chains of hyaluronic acid (HA) were hydrophobically
   modified using hexadecyl short chains. The rheological properties as
   well as the 3D printability were investigated. Methods: HA of Mw = 76.6
   kDa was hydrophobically modified by conjugation of parts of its primary
   hydroxyl groups with hexadecyl chains in two steps. The ratio of
   substitution was determined using 1HNMR spectroscopy. Two different
   hydrogels were prepared at polymer concentration of 0.4 and 1.6 wt\%.
   The rheological properties of both hydrogels were investigated using
   continuous flow experiment and cyclic strain time sweep experiment.
   Furthermore, the 3D printability of the hydrogels was studied using an
   extrusion-based 3D printer. Results: 1H NMR spectrum of the new product
   revealed that the substitution ratio was 40 mol\%. Furthermore, the
   modified polymer was able to form sable hydrogels at both polymer
   concentrations whereas unmodified HA was unable to form hydrogel at the
   same concentrations. The rheological experiments showed decreasing of
   hydrogels viscosity by increasing the shearing rate which points toward
   a shear thinning property. Both hydrogels showed sharp decreases in the
   storage moduli upon applying high strains. The hydrogel prepared using
   2.6 wt\% of the modified polymer showed, however, higher shape-fidelity
   for 3D printing compared to hydrogel at polymer concentration of 0.4
   wt\%. Discussion: Hydrophobic modification of HA using relatively short
   alkyl chains enables physical crosslinking between polymer chains to
   produce biocompatible and 3D-printable hydrogel using low concentration
   of modified polymer. The rheological properties suggest their
   suitability as ink for extrusion-based 3D bioprinting
   Objectives: High resolution imaging of living cells is impaired by
   artefacts introduced by chemical fixation and by the rapid movement of
   molecules during live cell imaging. We have therefore developed tools to
   cryo-arrest living cells on a microscope and image them by high- and
   super-resolution microscopy. However, the developed equipment is also
   applicable to investigate the process of cryopreservation. Methods: We
   have developed two different microscope cryo-stages that allow for
   continuous observation on the fluorescence microscope. One stage allows
   for relatively slow controlled cooling (<50 degrees C/min) and warming
   (<150 degrees C/min) of cells. It allows for medium exchange during
   cooling and warming and thus for change of concentration of
   cryoprotective agents. Due to the design of this microscope stage, oil
   immersion objectives can be used down to at least -45 degrees C. The
   second stage is designed to ultra-rapidly cool cells with >10000 degrees
   C/s to temperatures Results: We established a protocol to reversibly
   cryo-arrest living cells on a microscope stage. This permits to image
   physiological processes in the same living cells with practically
   unlimited acquisition time at consecutive points in time. This allowed
   for super-resolution imaging and microspectroscopy measurements, which
   were impeded at physiological temperatures, because of the dynamics of
   cellular molecules. The development of a device to ultra-rapidly
   cryo-arrest living cells on a microscope under continuous observation
   allowed for the investigation of cells, which have been
   cryo-arrested/vitrified within Discussion: The presented cryo-fixations
   methods enable a more precise measurement of molecular patterns and thus
   a better understanding of molecular organization in cells under
   physiological conditions. The developed microscopy stages should however
   also enable high- and super-resolution fluorescence imaging of molecular
   processes in cells during the process of cryopreservation.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is to provide a general overview of the
   design challenges in the wireless powering of artificial organs, to
   develop a general design strategy for inductive powering units (IPU),
   and to design a prototype IPU for mid-power application with high-stable
   output characteristic. Methods: Artificial organs can benefit greatly
   from inductive wireless powering, but there are several major design
   challenges which must be overcome. The high energy transfer efficiency
   must be ensured. The IPU must tolerate coils misalignments. Tissue
   overheating must be avoided. Biocompatible materials must be used. Size
   and weight restrictions must be taken into account. Finally, patient
   body specifics should be considered. We have developed a new general
   design strategy in which all mentioned problems are addressed. The main
   feature is that we simultaneously optimize the inductive link and the
   schematics of the transmitter and the receiver and take the body
   specific elements (the thickness of the skin and the fat layer) into
   account. We have developed strictly formal procedures which can be
   implemented using software in computer-aided design procedures. Results:
   In order to test and verify our approach we have designed a prototype
   IPU. The design goal was set as follows: IPU must ensure output power in
   the range 0.45 horizontal ellipsis 0.55 W for the axial distance between
   the coils in the range 10 horizontal ellipsis 20 mm and the lateral
   misalignments up to 20 mm. The design goal was achieved. Several coil
   couples were used to adjust optimal energy transfer distance to the
   expected implantation depth. Measurements were performed in the air as
   well as with the samples of ``skin-fat{''} biological objects were
   performed. Discussion: We have developed and tested design strategy for
   biomedical IPU which can provide reliable design adjusted to the various
   requirements and the specific of the patient's body.
   Objectives: The HeartMate 3 (HM3, Abbott Laboratories, USA) and
   HeartWare HVAD (Medtronic Inc., USA) clinically revealed a significantly
   different thrombogenic profile. In detail, while the HM3 has abated
   incidence of pump thrombosis, it was not associated with reduced stroke
   incidence. We numerically characterized and compared prothrombotic flow
   characteristics of the two pumps to provide mechanistic insights into
   observed clinical outcomes. Methods: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
   simulations were performed to evaluate flow fields associated with
   periodic speed modulation in the two pumps (the artificial pulse for the
   HM3 and the Lavare cycle for the HVAD). One-way coupling to a lumped
   parameter model of the cardiovascular system was employed to account for
   physiologic boundary conditions. Results were compared to baseline
   simulations with constant pressure head and rotor speed to
   comprehensively evaluate geometrical and speed modulation effects.
   Analysis of the thrombogenic potential was based on calculation of: i) a
   specific platelet activation marker, the Platelet Activity State (PAS),
   using time course of viscous and Reynolds stress computed on platelet
   trajectories probed using Lagrangian particle tracking, ii) scalar
   washout, iii) volumes of flow stagnation, and iv) wall shear stress
   patterns. Results: The HM3 and HVAD showed different PAS distribution.
   Speed modulation was associated with increased sum of viscous and
   Reynolds stresses and PAS magnitude. Analysis of temporal and spatial
   gradients of the shear stress histories calculated on platelet
   trajectories, volumes of stagnation, and wall shear stresses allowed
   identification of geometrical and operating parameters that might
   contribute to pump thrombogenicity and pump washout Discussion: We
   compared prothrombotic fluid dynamic features of the HM3 and HVAD under
   realistic dynamic operating conditions. Our results provide a
   ``numerical rationale{''} for the observed clinical outcomes.
   Objectives: Over time left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) have become
   an alternative to heart transplantation because of enormous technical
   development and miniaturization. Implantation of these systems has been
   proven to lead to considerably improved survival, with an increase in
   quality of life. Following implantation, most patients display a
   considerable improvement in physical capacity, measured according to the
   New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, even though exercise
   tolerance levels following the implantation of an LVAD are still
   considerably restricted. Methods: Current state of scientific knowledge
   with respect to the physical capacity of patients with terminal heart
   failure after LVAD implantation is described at rest and during
   exercise. The significance of new diagnostic tools, such as the
   non-invasive inert gas rebreathing method for measurement of cardiac
   output and arteriovenous oxygen difference (AVDO2) in assessment of the
   performance of LVAD patients is discussed. Results: Pump flow across the
   LVAD can be increased to a certain degree during exercise and normal
   everyday activities via two mechanisms: exercise-dependent tachycardia
   and increase of enddiastolic pressure in the left ventricle in
   conjunction with increased preloading. The share of the native left
   ventricle in systemic perfusion can also increase during exercise. Here,
   left-ventricular pressure exceeds systemic blood pressure and the aortic
   valve opens. The contractile reserve of the myocardium does, of course,
   play a crucial role. Discussion: Ultimately, the cardiopulmonary
   capacity of LVAD patients is restricted to a higher degree during
   exercise, even after implantation. Larger studies are required to
   clarify the extent to which longer-term physical exercise training after
   discharge from rehabilitation and/or an increase in the number of pump
   rotations can lead to increased physical capacity in LVAD patients.
   Objectives: The epidemiology of heart failure (HF) is a rising medical
   burden with an estimated growing rate of 46\% from 2012 to 2030. Left
   Ventricular Assist Devices (LVAD) and minimally invasive techniques are
   nowadays key therapies to guarantee optimal treatments for each HF
   patient. So far, clinical experience with minimally-invasive LVAD
   surgery showed promising short-term results. The aim of this study is to
   evaluate the long-term results of the first series of patients who
   received minimally-invasive LVAD surgery at our institution. Methods: We
   reviewed the short and long term outcomes of 111 end-stage HF patients
   who received an LVAD implantation (HVAD, HeartWare, Medtronic, USA) at
   our institution between 2011 and 2014. All patients underwent an upper
   hemisternotomy and left-sided anterolateral thoracotomy with
   cardiopulmonary bypass. Results: Between 2011 and 2014, 111
   minimally-invasive LVAD implantations were performed at our institution
   (78\% male, 22\% female; mean age 52 +/- 4; dilated cardiomyopathy
   42.6\%; ischaemic cardiomyopathy 44.4\%, other aetiologies 13\%).
   Postoperative bleeding incidence was 9.6\% leading to a low amount of
   applied packed red blood cells (mean: 4.9 rbc), short ICU stay (mean 9.3
   days), and a low incidence of right heart failure (4.6\%). Thirty-day
   mortality was 5.2\%, 90-day mortality 9.0\% and 1-year survival 88\%.
   Long-term follow-up (median 6.4 years) demonstrated a mortality of
   51,4\%, a transplant rate of 16.4\%, and an explant rate of 1,7\%.
   15.8\% of patients underwent pump exchange and 30,3\% of patients had
   still an ongoing LVAD therapy at the time of follow-up. Discussion:
   Minimally-invasive LVAD implantations are proven to be safe and
   associated with a lower perioperative complication and mortality rate.
   By using an upper hemisternotomy with an anterolateral thoracotomy, the
   intra-hospital outcomes showed promising results impacting also the
   long-term follow-up which presented an excellent percentage of ongoing
   LVAD therapies.
   Objectives: Quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) provides fast and
   label-free analysis of living cells by minimized interaction with the
   sample. The analysis of QPM images enables the determination of
   morphological cell parameters like cell thickness and elongation and
   facilitates single cell tracking for migration analysis. Methods: To
   demonstrate the potential of QPM in determining the metastatic potential
   of cells, we have developed a fully automated QPM system utilizing
   digital holographic microscopy (DHM) in an off-axis Mach-Zehnder
   configuration. Different pancreatic tumor cell lines, beating heart
   cells, white blood cells and in vitro toxicology models were analyzed
   for refraction index, cell volume, cell area, dry mass and cell
   morphology dependent processes. Results: The morphological analysis of
   the different cell lines via QPM in combination with image
   segmentation-based evaluation of the retrieved quantitative phase images
   showed that QPI could identify and quantify cell types and cellular
   processes by cell specific properties as cell proliferation, cell death,
   3D cell migration or cell height. E. g. cells with a high metastatic
   potential had a lower cell thickness and a higher elongation than cells
   with a low metastatic potential. Moreover, computer assisted tracking of
   single cells showed that highly metastatic cells covered a longer
   distance and had a higher motility compared to cells with a low
   metastatic potential. Also white blood cell types and disease or drug
   induced morphological blood cell alterations could be separated.
   Discussion: In summary, the multi-functional potential of QPM in various
   cell biological applications as cancer cell or stem cell research,
   toxicological and pharmacological screenings and cell quality control
   represents a promising new approach for a fast and label free
   phenotyping of different cell types and cellular processes. QPM meets
   the growing interest in label-free, optical techniques minimizing
   samples interaction.
   Objectives: Severe life-threatening thrombocytopenia may be caused by
   exceptionally wide range of clinical conditions. Currently, donor
   platelet (PLT) transfusion is the only efficient clinical approach to
   successfully treat thrombocytopenia. However, PLT transfusion is
   challenged by adverse immune responses and is limited the short shelf
   life of donated material. Previously, we showed the feasibility to
   generate iPSC-derived MKs in a large scale, which can be used as an
   alternative to conventional PLT transfusion. However, success of this
   perspective therapeutic approach requires efficient biobanking
   technologies that would allow long-term storage and accumulation of MKs
   in clinically sufficient amounts. In this study, we aimed at the
   development of an optimal biobanking strategies for the preservation of
   iPSC-derived MKs. Methods: Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and
   propane-1,2-diol (PD) were evaluated for their cryoprotective efficiency
   in iPSC-derived MKs. Comprehensive phenotypic characterization of MKs
   before and after cryopreservation was performed by fluorescence
   microscopy and flow cytometry. Capability of cryopreserved MKs to form
   proPLTs and release functional PLTs has been tested in vitro.
   Transfusion into animal model has been performed to evaluate capability
   of MKs to release PLTs in vivo. Results and Discussion: Application of
   developed cryopreservation procedures allowed recovery of over 80\% of
   iPSC-derived MKs cryopreserved with Me2SO and PD. Recovered cell
   populations expressed typical MK markers, including CD41, CD61, and
   CD42a and showed high polyploidy. Moreover, cryopreserved MKs showed the
   capability to form proPLTs and release PLTs in vitro as well as in vivo
   after transfusion in animal model. Present findings propose efficient
   clinically relevant biobanking strategies necessary for progress in
   MK-based regenerative and replacement approaches.
   Objectives: Adverse events due to flow-induced blood damage remain a
   serious problem for blood pumps as cardiac support systems. The
   numerical prediction of blood damage via computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) is a helpful tool for the design and optimization of reliable
   pumps. Blood damage prediction models primarily are based on the acting
   shear stresses, which are calculated by solving the Navier-Stokes
   equations on computational grids. The purpose of this paper is to
   analyze the influence of the spatial discretization and the associated
   discretization error on the shear stress calculation in a blood pump in
   comparison to other important flow quantities like the pressure head of
   the pump. Methods: CFD analysis using seven Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged
   Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations were performed. Two simple stress
   calculation indicators were applied to estimate the influence of the
   discretization on the results using an approach to calculate numerical
   uncertainties, which indicates discretization errors. Results: For the
   finest grid with 19 million elements, numerical uncertainties up to 20
   \% for shear stresses were determined, while the pressure heads show
   smaller uncertainties with a maximum of 4.8 \%. Discussion: No
   grid-independent solution for velocity gradient-dependent variables
   could be obtained on a grid size that is comparable to mesh sizes in
   state-of-the-art blood pump studies. It can be concluded that the grid
   size has a major influence on the shear stress calculation, and
   therefore the potential blood damage prediction, and that the
   quantification of this error should always be taken into account.
   Objectives: The piezoelectric effect of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
   is a promising property to be considered when controlling the diffusion
   of ions through membranes. This study examines the impact of different
   solvents and their ratios on the piezoelectric beta-phase of PVDF and on
   the diffusion rates of fiber membranes. Methods: Fiber mats were
   polarized via electrospinning using 20w\% PVDF solutions with solvent
   mixtures of dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethylacetamide (DMAc) as first
   solvent and acetone or methyl acetate (MeOAc) as second solvent in
   different ratios. Conversion of non-polar alpha-phase into polar
   beta-phase was evaluated via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
   (FTIR). Diffusion experiments were performed by measuring changes in
   conductivity of deionized water (1.5 mu S/cm) for 150min under static
   and cyclic loading conditions. Results: Polymer solutions showed a
   non-Newtonian behavior. An increasing acetone ratio led to decreasing
   densities in PVDF solutions. Densities remained unchanged for all MeOAc
   ratios. FTIR results for MeOAc-solubilized PVDF fiber mats showed lower
   intensity of alpha-phase peaks at 762cm(-1) as compared to acetone
   solubilized ones. The intensity of the characteristic 840cm(-1) polar
   beta-phase peak rose with a higher ratio of the second solvent.
   Diffusion experiments with piezoelectric PVDF membranes (n=5) inhibited
   sodium chloride diffusion under static conditions (67 mu S/cm) while
   induction of the direct piezoelectric effect allowed for increased
   diffusion (533 mu S/cm). Discussion: Solvent properties and ratios
   influence the intrinsic properties of PVDF solutions for electrospinning
   and consequently affect beta-phase conversion. Especially, MeOAc in
   combination with DMF or DMAc has a positive effect on piezoelectric
   beta-phase conversion. With suitable process parameters, piezoelectric
   fiber mats can be produced for active filter membranes. Ongoing
   experiments aim to investigate their molecular weight cut-off
   properties.
   Objectives: A cochlear implant (CI) is an auditory neuroprosthesis used
   to restore hearing in deaf and profoundly deaf patients. It features an
   electrode array (EA) which needs to be inserted into the inner ear
   (cochlea) to enable electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve.
   Spatial proximity of the EA and the nerve fibers is considered
   beneficial. This requires a shape change of the initially straight EA to
   enclose the inner wall of the spiral-shaped inner ear after
   implantation. Thin wires made of Nitinol-a shape memory alloy (SMA)-are
   investigated regarding their applicability as embedded actuators to
   implement a shape change. Methods: Nitinol wires ( null 100 mu m) have
   been trained to a spiral shape which was derived from cross-sectional
   images of a human specimen as an exemplary adaption to a specific
   cochlea geometry. Ten different variations of thermomechanical
   processing were applied by the supplier (G.RAU GmbH \& Co. KG) to tailor
   the shape memory effect to the application specific requirements. In
   order to determine the resulting transformation temperatures (AS, AF) a
   bend and free recovery (BFR) test suitable for curved wires was
   developed and utilized. Results: It is possible to design and fabricate
   spiral-shaped SMA wires which fit to a specific cochlea shape. The
   developed BFR test setup allows for measuring the thermomechanical
   properties of these actuators in an application oriented manner. This
   provides slightly higher but more realistic measures for AS and AF
   compared to differential scanning calorimetry. Discussion: A complete
   design, manufacturing and validation process for thin spiral shape
   memory wires could be established. The next step is to integrate these
   wires into an EA and perform BFR measurements again as it is known that
   external forces due to stiffness of the EA alter the transformation
   temperatures.
   Objectives: The purpose of the work is to develop a theoretical basis
   for determining the thickness of the laminar boundary layer in the nasal
   cavity during respiration. Methods: Methods for obtaining basic
   scientific and practical results are based on the general principles of
   theoretical physics and aerodynamics in order to determine the laminar
   boundary layer of air flow in the upper respiratory tract. Results:
   Using the aerodynamic approach to the study of respiratory and olfactory
   disorders revealed that the thickness of the laminar boundary layer
   decreases with decreasing equivalent diameter of the nasal cavity and
   with increasing Reynolds number, which characterizes the degree of
   turbulence in the air flow. Typical values of the thickness of the
   laminar boundary layer are in the range of 0.2-0.05 mm, depending on the
   mode of nasal breathing and the configuration of the nasal cavity. The
   data obtained characterizes the effect of airflow on the mucous membrane
   of the nasal cavity: if the heterogeneity of the mucosal surface extends
   beyond the boundary of the laminar boundary layer, then such portions of
   the nasal cavity are exposed to turbulent flow, which leads to
   overdrying. The size of the heterogeneities of the mucosa is determined
   by tomographic data during their processing at the sub-pixel level,
   which allows for the investigation of the effect of the intensity of the
   boundary elements of the walls of the nasal passages. Discussion: A
   model of the distribution of airflow velocities in the nasal cavity in
   the turbulent mode is proposed; it has a logarithmic or power profile
   cross section, and within the laminar boundary layer the air velocity
   increases linearly to almost the max value. The current air velocity in
   the cross sections amounted to 5-7 m/s. The feature of the developed
   method is transitioned to hydraulic diameter, which takes into account
   complex configuration of the nasal cavity, as well as an anatomically
   narrow area - the olfactory slit.
   Objectives: Bioengineering of elements of the musculo-skeletal system is
   rich in studies concerning bone reconstruction. Among them, the culture
   of cells on a osteogenic electrospun scaffold under dynamic conditions
   is an interesting option. However, one should also consider the
   reconstruction of tendon and muscle finally mimicking a continuum from
   bone to muscle. Methods: Poly-caprolactone (PCL) 10\% was electrospun on
   a rotating collector whose velocity varied to get random or aligned
   nanofibers. Bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) and C2C12 cells were
   respectively seeded on the materials. Mechanical or electrical stresses
   were applied to the biohybrid scaffolds to differentiate cells towards
   tendon's or muscle's phenotypes, in the absence any specific biochemical
   factors. Results: After 2 weeks of culture under dynamic stretching
   (1Hz, 4\% strain for an hour followed by 11h of rest), BMSCs were found
   to align in the stretching direction, presented increased levels of
   tenomodulin and neosynthetized collagen, compared to static conditions.
   C2C12 differentiation until aligned myotubes stage was more difficult to
   achieve. We proposed to add a PEG microstructure to guide cell growth.
   Combined to electrical stimulation, it led to the cells fusion into very
   long myotubes hosting many nuclei, as expected. Discussion: In this
   study, we managed to grow two different types of cells and generate
   their differentiation towards tendon and muscle lineage, in the absence
   of any differentiation factors. The next step is to implement the
   co-culture on different areas of the same electrospun scaffold, to let
   the cells proliferate and study the events occurring at the junction.
   Objectives: Alarm fatigue is a safety and quality problem where exposure
   to high rates of clinical alarms results in desensitization leading to
   cognitive bias or slowed response to alarms. One reason for alarm
   fatigue is false pressure alarms during extracorporeal blood therapies.
   It is clear that current machine algorithms based on simple threshold
   monitoring must be replaced by intelligent algorithms that avoid any
   false positive alarm. Methods: Detailed analysis of arterial pressure,
   venous pressure, transmembrane pressure, ultrafiltration rate and
   relative blood volume during hemodialysis was performed using a patient
   data base. Main causes of pressure alarms were identified, analysed and
   replicated during simulated hemodialysis therapies with a FMC 4008
   hemodialysis device and a patient simulator. Results: Data analysis
   shows clear evidence that even slowly drifting adaptive baseline alarms
   which are currently in use lead to false positive alarms with a high
   probability during nearly every treatment. Pressure variations which are
   induced by local flow and blood viscosity changes can be identified
   reliably by use of algorithms based on pattern recognition. Pressure
   variations from patient movements and changes in blood pressure show a
   different pattern that can be used to distinguish between true alarm
   events and false positive events. Discussion: For 25 years, it has been
   known that alarm systems which monitor whether a threshold value is
   exceeded have a rate of false alarms of 77-99,5\% depending on the
   physiologic parameter monitored (Wiklund et al., 1994). New adaptive
   algorithms based on pattern recognition principles help to combine both
   maximum patient safety and avoidance of false positive pressure alarms.
   Objectives: In vivo tissue engineered vascular tissues ``Biotubes{''}
   constructed in the subcutaneous spaces of the recipients exhibited
   superior functions. However, since the formation of the vascular tissues
   depends on the recipient conditions, chemical pretreatments such as
   dehydration by ethanol (ET) or crosslinking by glutaraldehyde (GA) were
   attempted to improve their initial mechanical durability. Last year, we
   reported that ET and GA increased the burst pressure of the tissues and
   did not affect their suture retention strength. This year, we measured 3
   parameters of mechanical properties: ultimate tensile strength (UTS),
   ultimate strain (\%) and Young's modulus. Methods: Tubular tissues (ID:
   5 mm) constructed in the subcutaneous tissues of beagle dogs (4 weeks,
   n=3) were separated to the 3 groups, raw tissue group with no treatments
   (RAW), that under dehydration with 70\% ET (ET) for 10 min and
   crosslinking with 0.6\% GA (GA) for 10 min. We measured 3 parameters
   shown above, by tissue ringlet pull test. Results: There were no
   significant differences in UTS (RAW: 3.765 +/- 0.662 MPa, ET: 4.330 +/-
   0.619 MPa, GA: 3.763 +/- 0.438 MPa, p=0.409) or ultimate strain (RAW:
   30.15 +/- 1.60 \%, ET: 41.22 +/- 6.11 \%, GA: 37.73 +/- 4.36 \%,
   p=0.209) between the 3 groups. Young's modulus of ET group was
   significantly higher among the 3 groups (RAW: 5.41 +/- 1.16 MPa, ET:
   12.28 +/- 2.55 MPa, GA: 7.65 +/- 1.18 MPa, p= 0.0289). Discussion: Short
   period of chemical treatment using ET and GA might make it possible to
   control the mechanical properties of in vivo tissue engineered vascular
   tissues to produce the ideal grafts in mechanical aspects.
   Objectives: Stent graft development is one of the most important topics
   for countries with a large number of elderly people. However, very
   little research has been carried out using model circulation of the
   aortic dissection. Quantitative evaluation and development have been
   difficult, because there was no model. Methods: In this study, a fluid
   dynamical circuit model circulation simulating the left heart
   circulation of the dissecting aortic aneurysm was developed with a
   pulsatile blood pump. Various shapes of the inflow side and outflow side
   for the pseudo lumen were used in the experimental series. Furthermore,
   an animal model of the dissecting aneurysm was developed using a
   mechanical dissecting method and flow patterns of the animal aortas with
   the model dissecting aneurysm, after the ethical committee's approval.
   Flow and pressure pattern time series data was recorded in the digital
   recorder and a quantitative evaluation was carried out. Results: Flow of
   the true lumen and pseudo lumen was divided with a thin membrane.
   Various amounts of the flow and pressure was observed and recorded.
   Membrane of the dissecting aortic aneurysm was simulated with rubber
   sheet. After the insertion of the aortic stent, the shapes of the flow
   and pressure pattern were altered. Animal experiments to develop the
   dissecting aneurysm were difficult. Firstly the aorta of the goats was
   removed, and then the dissecting aneurysm was to be constructed by the
   detachment of the tunica media of the aortic wall. Flow pattern of the
   experimental Aorta was recorded. Discussion: Quantitative evaluation of
   the Aortic Stent expanding performance and pressure and flow pattern in
   the true and pseudo lumen had been observed in the mock circulation
   loop. Furthermore, animal model of the dissecting aorta will be useful
   material for the development of the stent graft in the near future.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is to investigate the performance of
   the RealHeart (TM)psi total artificial heart (TAH) with a hybrid cardiac
   simulator (HCS). Methods: The HCS, developed at the Nalecz Institute of
   Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering, is a computational-hydraulic
   model of the cardiovascular system. Four hydro-numerical interfaces
   reproduced the pressure/flow profiles of atria, pulmonary artery, and
   aorta hydraulically, while the rest of the circulation was numerical.
   The TAH was connected accordingly. The TAH is a pulsatile 4-chamber
   device whose left and right sides can operate independently, by changing
   pulse rate (PR) and stroke length (SL). The TAH was tested on the HCS at
   low/medium operating points: PR 60/80/100/120 bpm; SL 20/22/24/26 mm;
   systole duration ratio 0.4 of the TAH cycle. Systemic resistance was
   changed between 0.8 and 1.2 mmHg/(ml/s), pulmonary resistance was
   changed between 0.1 and 0.2 mmHg/(ml/s). Systemic and pulmonary
   compliances were set to 1.4 ml/mmHg. Results: The independent tuning of
   PR and SL permits fine regulation the TAH flow on the left and right
   sides. As an example, for a peripheral resistance of 1.0 mmHg/(ml/s) the
   flow ranged from 2.7 l/min (PR=60,SL=20mm) to 7.0 l/min
   (PS=120,SL=26mm). For the investigated PRs and SLs, power consumption on
   the left pump ranged between 1.3 and 10.0 Watts and on the right pump
   between 0.9 and 6.0 Watts. The TAH provides a pulsatile flow, whose
   waveform depends on the SL and systole duration. This induced a pressure
   pulsatility ranging from 10mmHg (PR=60,SL=20mm) to 38 mmHg
   (PR=120,SL=26mm) in both the aorta and pulmonary artery. Discussion: The
   HCS is a flexible test bench to evaluate the TAH performance in
   different hemodynamic conditions. The tuning of PR and SL on the left
   and right side of the TAH, independently, offers flexibility in
   regulating cardiac output and in managing the left/right flow balance.
   Power consumption is in the range suitable for clinical applications.
   Objectives: In case of chronic mechanical circulatory support, it is
   highly desirable to fully understand the interaction between the beating
   left ventricle and the VAD in order to potentially reduce adverse
   events. Thus, we took the VAD's perspective and investigated the flow
   inside a VAD in an advanced development status during the time course of
   a heartbeat. Methods: The study is conducted with computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) applying realistic pressure boundary conditions for left
   ventricular and arterial pressure and the results are compared to
   results produced with an established, active mock circulation loop. Due
   to the high resolution in time and space and the use of sliding mesh
   interfaces, local flow phenomena during different phases of systole and
   diastole are unmasked. The effects of inertia in the pump and cannulae
   become evident, which are not modeled in more traditional VAD flow
   simulations with steady-state boundary conditions. Results: The results
   show that hysteresis effects due to inertia are quantitatively of high
   importance. The hysteresis curves of the VAD operational point obtained
   experimentally and numerically correlate well. Moreover, the results
   show that a VAD design for a highly pulsed flow can lead to a situation,
   where almost no remaining stagnation zones, as quantified with a
   numerical stagnation index, exist during a heartbeat. Discussion:
   Despite increased computational costs, highly resolved CFD simulations
   in time and space with realistic time-varying boundary conditions are a
   powerful tool to increase understanding of the interaction of the
   mechanically supported circulation and the device itself. This enabled a
   verification of a VAD design with low to almost non-existing flow
   stagnation at constant rotational speed. This finding correlates well
   with the fact that the VAD does not require any anticoagulation in
   chronic animal trial testing lasting weeks to months.
   Objectives: The friction properties for the contact between contact
   lenses and the eyelid are the focus of current research in order to
   optimize the wearing comfort. The tribological system consisting of
   contact lense, eyelid and tear fluid should be considered. Suitable
   measurement conditions must be used for the examinations. Methods: In
   this research the nano- and microtribological friction properties of
   hard and soft (hydrogel) contact lenses were investigated. The friction
   conditions were investigated by nano scratch test; moreover, a
   nanotribometer was used to evaluate the frictional properties during
   sliding on the lenses. Contact lens fluid was applied as lubricant for
   both cases. Results: The friction coefficients of hard contact lenses
   and hydrogel lenses were detected for a range of speeds and loads. It
   was possible to examine the differences of the both contact lenses in
   detail. For the nano scratch and friction tests, there is a dependency
   of speed and normal force. Discussion: In case of nano-scratch tests,
   the frictional properties were investigated wile ploughing. This case
   shows the elastic- and plastic material properties besides the friction.
   In the case of the frictional tests, the measuring tip slides without
   ploughing. Due to the lubrication conditions, the soft hydrogel lenses
   feature a much lower friction coefficient. In case of the hard contact
   lenses, the coefficient of friction is comparable to the nano scratch
   test, as there is no lubrication film between both measuring tips and
   the contact lens. For further work it is mandatory to work under
   standazdized measurement conditions.
   Objectives: Patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) show an
   increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity mainly due to the
   accumulation of protein-bound uremic retention solutes. Dialysis
   therapies have been optimized for the removal of low-molecular weight
   water-soluble and unbound uremic retention solutes, but not for
   protein-bound uremic retention solutes. Therefore, there is a strong
   need to increase the portion of unbound fractions in order to increase
   the clearance for these uremic toxins. Methods: We developed dialysis
   techniques where the protein-bound uremic retention solutes are removed
   more efficiently under high ionic strength or high-frequent electric
   fields. The protein integrity of proteins and enzymatic activities were
   analysed. Results: The protein-bound fraction of phenylacetic acid,
   indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate was significantly decreased by
   using high ionic strength or high-frequent electric fields Discussion:
   Although protein-bound uremic retention solutes have a major impact on
   the morbidity and mortality of CKD patients, the clearance of these
   solutes by conventional extracorporeal therapies is low until now. These
   uremic toxins bind to plasma proteins with a molecular weight greater
   than the cut-off of dialysis membranes and therefore conventional
   dialysis therapies do not sufficiently remove protein-bound uremic
   toxins. Disruption of association with protein and uremic solute is one
   possibility to significantly improve the removal of protein-bound uremic
   toxins. Therefore, we developed approaches for an increased release
   protein-bound uremic retention solutes from their protein-binding
   resulting in an increased clearance. Conclusion: Improvements of
   therapies for CKD patients are essential. Especial the consideration of
   removing hydrophobic protein-bound uremic toxins via new methods like
   application of high-electric fields or increased ionic strength is a
   further progress
   Objectives: Tissue decellularization is one of the novel techniques in
   tissue engineering and regenerative medicine for obtaining extracellular
   matrix, which doesn't preserve mechanical properties of native tissue.
   Modified by the extracellular matrix, silk fibroin scaffolds can combine
   high biocompatibility and suitable mechanical properties. Methods:
   Wistar rats were used as liver donors. Decellularization of liver tissue
   was performed by sequential incubation with three solutions of 0,1\% SDS
   containing Triton X-100 in the following concentrations: 1\%, 2\% and
   3\%. Livers were ground in liquid nitrogen and a certain fraction of
   microparticles was separated by precipitation and centrifugation. Silk
   fibroin scaffolds were prepared by a casting method using water as a
   solvent. Microparticle suspension was blended with fibroin solution
   before film preparation. Scaffold structure was investigated by scanning
   probe nanotomography (SPM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The
   cytotoxicity of scaffolds, cell adhesion and proliferation were
   evaluated. Modified scaffolds were used as wound coatings in a
   full-thickness skin wound model. Results: Microparticles with a size
   less than 5 mu m were prepared from decellularized liver tissue.
   Modified silk fibroin scaffolds were obtained. Sinuous and rough
   topography of the obtained matrix was shown. The produced scaffolds did
   not show cytotoxic effect. The cells adhesion was significantly higher
   on scaffolds modified with decellularized liver tissue microparticles in
   comparison with non-modified scaffolds. Modified silk fibroin scaffolds
   promoted skin wound regeneration by 30\% in comparison with non-modified
   scaffolds. Discussion: Regenerative potential of extracellular matrix as
   microparticles was shown. Decellularization of organs and tissues may be
   used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine for increasing the
   biocompatibility of the artificial grafts.
   Hemodialysis is an important therapy for End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)
   patients if a donor kidney is not available. During four hours of
   conventional therapy, three times a week, mainly small water-soluble
   toxins and a limited number of middle molecules are effectively removed
   from the patients' blood {[}1]. Besides, the therapy is non-continuous,
   causing large fluctuations in water balance and uremic waste, potassium
   and phosphate. Therefore, in recent years, many developments are
   focussed on longer treatment times, such as, nocturnal dialysis or
   application of a portable or wearable artificial kidney (PAK or WAK
   respectively). The continuous therapy outside the hospital requires
   application of membranes with long-term selectivity, fouling resistance
   and blood compatibility as well as demands reduced amount of water. In
   fact, for WAK, a small volume of spent dialysate should be continuously
   regenerated and reused. In this lecture, we will discuss all these
   important issues, including:
   Strategies for achieving endotoxin-free dialysate since the continuous
   recirculation of the dialysate for prolonged time demands additional
   efforts to avoid microbial contamination, without extra water
   consumption and without affecting the overall weight of the system.
   Strategies for achieving dialysate regeneration and especially urea
   removal since its daily molar production is higher than that of other
   waste solutes.
   Objectives: Ventricular assist devices are a commonly used therapy for
   end stage heart failure patients. Pump thrombosis is one of the most
   common problems in patients supported by an LVAD. Two types of thrombus
   can be distinguished: white thrombi and red thrombi. The only available
   option to combat a PT is a lysis therapy or a pump exchange. The
   objective of the presented study is to develop a relevant white pump
   thrombus model to promote development of these concepts. Methods: We
   developed an in vitro mock circulation system. The artificial blood
   circulation is provided by a HVAD. The HVAD pumps 80ml of human blood
   through the silicone loop. Parameters for inducing the white thrombus
   are high shear stress (4000 revolutions per minute), a rougher surface
   of the rotor, and an added activator of the intrinsic coagulation
   cascade. After two hours, the HVAD-system was checked for a white
   thrombus. Generated thrombi were stored for subsequent analysis
   (scanning electron microscopy and mechanical stability). Results:
   Thrombus generation was reproducible in number and geometry. After ten
   test runs, 23 thrombi were detected. All these generated thrombi had a
   minimal size of 12 mm(2). The developed thrombi are very similar in
   structure compared to white patient thrombi explanted in clinic. The
   scanning electron microscope showed a fibrin net on the surface of all
   tested thrombi (n=5). All tested thrombi samples (n=5) resist high
   strength (max. 1.029 MPa) in compression tests, which is typical for
   white PT. Discussion: The size of the thrombus should be increased for
   special investigational needs. A protocol was developed for reproducible
   and reliable production of white, shear induced thrombi for lysis
   therapy investigations. In addition, the similarity (biological
   structure, mechanical stability) to explanted patient thrombi was shown.
   However, additional analyses should be performed for further
   characterization of the artificial thrombi.
   Patient-specific anatomies can be reconstructed with a precision of
   approximately 0.5mm, using state of the art imaging modalities. This
   refers both to hard and soft tissues, hence with applications in
   clinical domains such as orthopedics, dentistry, cardiovascular surgery.
   Datamining techniques such as statistical shape modeling support the
   generation of biofidelic computer models. However, these models have to
   be fed with accurate data to reflect not only the geometry but also the
   material properties, the loading conditions and the interface between
   implants and bone in case of prosthetic reconstruction. The challenge is
   to optimize the interface between host tissue and implant in order to
   achieve maximum long-term functionality, but this optimization is also
   dependent on the optimization of the interfacing between the implant,
   the surgeon and the host tissue. Thus also the surgical technique will
   benefit from engineering support. Biomedical engineering is a key player
   to achieve this. A good geometric fit between implant and host tissue
   will ensure optimal initial stability. Patient-specific implants can
   ensure this stability, incorporating solid and porous structures where
   needed. Pre-operative computer assisted planning allows to optimize the
   surgical intervention, incorporating patient-specific biomechanical
   models to predict the functional outcome of the surgical intervention.
   And finally, in order to achieve that the pre-operative plan is
   accurately transferred into the surgical practice, computer assisted
   surgery enabled by e.g. navigation, robotics of patient-specific
   surgical instrumentation (guides and implants) can come into play. Key
   to all state of the art developments in computer assisted surgery is the
   engineering on anatomy, enabled by multifunctional softwares and 3D
   printing technologies. Biomechanical modeling allows for
   patient-specific outcome prediction after surgical interventions and
   should become a routine practice in patient treatment. Patient specific
   surgical instrumentation is able to assist in realising the plan with
   sub-millimeter precision. Finally, quantification of the uncertainties
   that are inherent to biomechanical modeling is an essential contribution
   to reliable patient-specific outcome prediction.
   Objectives: Hemodialysis (HD) is a lifesaving therapy in patients with
   end stage renal disease. Little is known about why life expectancy for
   these patients is reduced in Europe and USA as compared to Japan. The
   aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of the interdialytic
   weight gain (fluid retention in relation to estimated body weight in \%,
   IDWG) in relation to the dialysis length (hours). Methods: 20
   hemodialysis patients performed besides their regular dialyses 1
   hemodialysis/week within the frame of the study during a 3 week period.
   The baseline values and the change during HD of NT-pro-BNP (ProBNP) and
   Troponin T (TnT) at 180 minutes and pentraxin 3 (PTX) at 30 and 180min
   were compared with the change in IDWG divided by the hours the patient
   performed the HD as a marker of speed of ultrafiltration. The PROOF
   formula used was: {[}100 x Weight gain between dialysis
   (kg)]/{[}estimated body dry weight (kg) x time of HD session (hours)].
   Spearmans correlation analysis was used to adjust for eventual outliers.
   Results: There was a correlation between extent of removal of the
   IDWG/hours of HD: 1) the baseline values of ProBNP (rho=0.54, p<0.001),
   TnT (rho=0.37, p=0.004), PTX (rho=0.26, p=0.043) and 2) the change
   during HD at 30 min of PTX (rho=0.27, p=0.038) and at 180 minutes of
   ProBNP (rho=0.68, p<0.001) and TnT (rho=0.40, p=0.002). 3) a PROOF
   breakpoint < 0.63 caused less release of ProBNP (p<0.001). Discussion:
   The increase in weight between dialyses should be related to the body
   weight. A larger IDWG gives worse conditions. An increased speed of
   fluid in relation to body weight removal causes a higher release of
   cardiac markers indicating a strain and damage to the heart by each HD
   in contrast to what would be expected. Patients should be advised to
   limit fluid intake in relation to their body weight and adjust the HD
   length.
   Objectives: Fish roe is a highly nutritional product with diverse
   beneficial effects for the human health. This work used sardine (Sardina
   pilchardus) roe to produce novel delivery systems presenting antioxidant
   and anti-inflammatory properties. Methods: Methyl-tert-butyl ether
   extraction method was used to obtain lipid- and water-soluble compound
   rich phases. The fatty acids profile was analyzed by GC/MS. The
   identification of the hydrophilic compounds was performed by LC-HRMS.
   Lipids were used to produce large unilamellar liposomes (LUVs). The
   hydration of the lipid film was performed with PBS or sardine
   roe-derived aqueous phase. LUVs were characterized by their size,
   surface potential and morphology. The cytotoxicity of the extracts was
   evaluated using L929 cells. Their antioxidant activity was evaluated
   against different radicals, and their anti-inflammatory activity was
   assessed in the presence of LPS-stimulated macrophages. Results: GC/MS
   analyses demonstrated the presence of several fatty acids, such as omega
   3 fatty acids. LC-HRMS analyses revealed the presence of numerous
   bioactive compounds (e.g. essential amino acids and gadusol). LUVs
   prepared with the aqueous phase presented a higher heterogeneity in
   terms of size than when they were prepared with buffer. Both LUVs
   formulations have a negative surface charge and a spherical shape. The
   extracts presented antioxidant activity against peroxyl, hydroxyl and
   nitric oxide radicals. Biological assays indicated that the extracts are
   cytocompatible for the lowest tested concentrations and that they can
   inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which reveals their
   anti-inflammatory effect. Discussion: Our sardine roe-derived delivery
   systems and compounds have both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
   activities and thus they may be considered as a valid alternative for
   the treatment of inflammatory conditions.
   Objectives: Engineered skeletal muscle tissues in three-dimensional (3D)
   cell culture platforms that resemble the muscles complex native
   structure and organization can be used as in vitro models to study
   muscle physiology and metabolism. This project allows us to develop a
   new platform to model muscle diseases (such as myotonic dystrophy 1) in
   vitro in order to study its response to candidate therapeutics and to
   better understand disease mechanisms of pathogenesis. To this end, we
   monitor the secretion of disease-associated biomarker proteins and
   metabolites. Methods: Here, we present 3D skeletal muscle constructs,
   fabricated by encapsulating C2C12 cells and patient-derived
   transdifferentiated skin fibroblasts in a photocrosslinkable Gelatin
   Methacrylate and Carbolymethylcellulose Methacrylate (GelMA:CMCMA)
   hydrogel and cryogel scaffold. These scaffolds present a microgrooved
   topography that promotes cell alignment and differentiation. Electrical
   stimulation (ES) was then applied to the engineered tissues during cell
   culture to induce spontaneous contraction and maturation of the
   sarcomeres. Cell alignment differentiation, and the effect of ES were
   assessed by calculating the orientation angle and fusion index of
   immunostained myotubes expressing Myosin Heavy Chain (MHC). Results: We
   have obtained a new platform to study the evolution of congenital muscle
   diseases, specifically myotonic dystrophy 1 and evaluate the functional
   tissues by metabolic and gene expression analysis. Monitor the secretion
   of biomarkers proteins, metabolites, and the glycolysis pathway of
   muscle tissues for different drug candidates. Discussion: This platform
   has been tested with different drugs assays and represent a step toward
   the goal of producing in vitro drug testing systems for medical and
   pharmaceutical industry applications. Finally, such ``muscle
   tissue-on-a-chip{''} devices can be fabricated using patient's own cells
   as a major step toward personalized medicine.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is the creation and research of
   properties of tissue-engineering structures by the method of laser
   structuring a nanocarbon framework in bioorganic matrices. Methods: For
   the formation of the framework fibers from single-walled carbon
   nanotubes were used. Aqueous dispersions of nanocarbon fibers and
   proteins of albumin, collagen and amino sugar of chitosan were used as
   the initial medium for printing tissue-engineering structures. Printing
   of structures was carried out using the laser device generating pulsed
   laser radiation. The radiation wavelength was 1064 nm (100 ns pulse
   duration, 100 kHz frequency). Laser radiation using the scanner system
   of the device was moved on the dispersion layer. A computer model
   regulated the trajectory of the movement of radiation. Results: We have
   demonstrated the effect of welding nanocarbon fibers into a framework
   under the action of laser irradiation. The functionalization of
   nanocarbon fibers by protein and amino sugar molecules were proven. It
   was found the diameter of nanocarbon fibers was increased by several
   tens of nanometers due to their wrapping with a bio-organic matrix.
   Tissue-engineering structures had a meshy frame. The mesh size was
   100x100 mu m. The electrical conductivity of the structures increased
   several times and amounted to 1 S/m with laser irradiation. The hardness
   of tissue-engineering structures was 150-370 MPa. The cytological
   compatibility of tissue-engineering structures with fibroblast cells and
   endothelial cells was tested. The density of proliferating cells on
   tissue-engineering structures was 33\% more compared to the control
   type. In vivo investigations indicated the rate of biodegradation of
   tissue-engineering structures when implanted in laboratory animals for
   60-90 days. Discussion: The investigated structures are promising for
   use in medical practice. Such structures can act as cardiac
   tissue-engineering implants since they have physicomechanical and
   biological properties similar to the parameters of cardiac tissue.
   Objectives: A major part of developing rotary blood pumps requires the
   optimization of hemolytic properties of the entire pump. The aim of this
   project was to compare blood flow simulation in the first and second
   generations of the ventricular assist device Sputnik and to evaluate its
   effect. Methods: Studies of the flow field were conducted with
   commercial CFD software ANSYS FLUENT 16.0, which uses a finite-volume
   approach. Scalar shear stresses were calculated for both pumps. The
   pumps were compared in terms of volumes subjected to certain viscous
   shear stress thresholds, below which no trauma was assumed (von
   Willebrand factor cleavage: 9 Pa, platelet activation: 50 Pa, and
   hemolysis: 150 Pa), associated residence times and recirculation zones.
   Results: Volume fractions of shear stress above 9 Pa, 50 Pa, 150 Pa were
   received: Sputnik-1 had 7.69 ml, 2,58ml, 0.74 ml, Sputnik-2 - 3.41 ml,
   1.07 ml, 0.22 ml. The sum of the cell residence times at these shear
   stresses is 0.5095 s for the Sputnik-1 and 0.2019 s for the Sputnik-2.
   The volumes of recirculation zones were obtained, the value is 4.36 ml
   for the Sputnik-1 and 1.72 ml for the Sputnik-2. Discussion: The second
   generation of the VAD Sputnik have better flow characteristics than
   first. In the operating point, the volume fraction of the shear stresses
   is less, the residence time is less and the volume of recirculation
   zones is less.
   Objectives: End-stage renal disease is increasing dramatically in the
   western world and represents a major challenge for health care. Due to
   organ shortage transplantation can help only a few patients who
   otherwise require lifelong hemodialysis. Access for hemodialysis is an
   essential point and carries a high morbidity mainly due to occlusion of
   arterio-venous fistulas (AVF) and/or grafts (AVG). Therefore,
   alternative graft material has to be considered such as tissue
   engineered vascular grafts for access in hemodialysis. Methods: Besides
   patient characteristics and technical issues of surgical procedures the
   choice of the vascular graft is essential. Despite optimization over the
   last years, the clinical results are still sub-optimal due to early
   thrombosis and late intimal hyperplasia of the non-degradable synthetic
   vascular grafts such as Expanded-polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), or,
   polyethylene terephthalate (Dacron). Results: New material developments
   and tissue engineering techniques have shown good pre-clinical and
   initial clinical results for AVG implantation in hemodialysis patients.
   These range from acellular and cell-based, stable or bio-degradable,
   synthetic scaffolds to biological (mandril-induced) or decellularized
   grafts as well as self-assembly technologies. Discussion: This symposium
   will review the clinical need and especially address new developments of
   vascular grafts based on tissue engineering.
   Modern heart failure therapy makes use of left ventricular assist
   devices for severe cases as well as other active implants. While these
   devices have come far from their beginnings with improved
   hemocompatibility, smaller size and less invasive implantation
   techniques, their advancement takes close cooperation of engineers and
   clinicians to face the challenges of further advancements. It is vital
   to ensure interdisciplinary communication and exchange to define the
   future of Mechanical Circulatory Support. On the engineering side,
   greater biocompatibility, patient-specificity and options for smart
   devices and telemedicine offer great potential. These developments go
   hand in hand with improved surgical technique and clinical expertise.
   This cooperation will allow us to work towards reduced mortality, less
   adverse clinical events and ultimately improved quality of life for the
   cardiac assist device patient of the future.
   Objectives: To elucidate the role of the solvent and pH in the
   conformational changes of human serum albumin (HSA) and its binding to
   fatty acids. Albumin is a key biomolecule, found in most fluids of the
   body. HSA functions as depot and carrier for many compounds like fatty
   acids and affects the pharmacokinetics of drugs. Importantly, HSA acts
   as a toxic waste handler, displays pseudo enzymatic properties and it is
   a valuable biomarker in many diseases. Structurally, HSA is a very
   soluble, extremely robust and usually monomeric protein, which features
   three alpha-helical homologous domains that fold into a characteristic
   heart shape. Despite its importance, the reversible pH-dependent
   conformational transitions of HSA in solution are not yet fully
   understood. Methods: To compute the stability differences between the
   different conformers of HSA, we combine molecular dynamics simulations
   (MD) with free energy calculations. We determine the conformational
   free-energy change between conformers of HSA obtained upon introducing
   perturbations in the surroundings (pH, solvent mixtures) and its
   physiologically native state. Extended constant-pH MDs followed by
   Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics simulations allow us modelling
   these systems at different pH values. We perform free energy
   perturbation calculations to characterize the binding sites of fatty
   acids to HSA under different conditions. Results and Discussion: We
   elucidate, at the molecular level, the effects of the solvent and pH on
   the conformational transitions and functionality of HSA. Our work allows
   establishing ways to modulate such transitions by tuning key
   biomolecular interactions, with implications for biomedical research.
   Objectives: The metal ions can affect differentiation of stem cells,
   which makes them interesting for applications in tissue engineering and
   regenerative in medicine. The layer-by-layer (LbL) technique is based on
   the alternating adsorption of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes to
   form polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM). Multilayer systems combined with
   metal ions of different concentration might be promising for making
   coatings on implants and scaffolds to regenerate tissues like bone,
   cartilage, and others. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
   influence of the concentration of metal ions on the physical properties
   of Polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM), and evaluate the effect of metal
   ions on stem cell adhesion. Methods: Polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM)
   prepared by layer-by-layer technique made of polysaccharides hyaluronan
   (HA) as polyanion and chitosan (Chi) as polycation were additionally
   cross-linked by metal ions (Cu2+, Co2+, Ca2+ and Fe3+). to modulate
   physical properties and bioactivity of multilayers to control adhesion
   and function of mesenchymal murine C3H10T1/2 embryonic fibroblasts.
   Characterization of multilayer formation and surface properties was
   performed by different analytical methods. Results: Changes of wetting,
   thickness and mechanical properties of multilayers depending on
   concentration and type of metal ion. Most interesting, however, was the
   finding that metal ions like Fe3+ promoted adhesion and spreading of
   C3H10T1/2 cell greatly on the less adhesive HA/Chi multilayer system
   Discussion: Multilayer systems combined with metal ions can be used to
   regenerate tissues like bone, cartilage and others
   Objectives: The aim of the study is to analyse and modify the gas
   transfer properties of a novel PMP fiber blood gas exchanger with a
   cylindrical shaped blood flow channel by improving the sweep gas flow
   profile through the fiber bundle while considering the fiber length in
   blood contact. Methods: A test set-up has been developed to visualize
   the gas flow through the fiber bundle by means of steam. In an in-vitro
   setting with porcine blood the gas transfer rate has been measured
   subsequently. The cylindrical blood flow geometry and the fact that the
   fibers are stacked with an offset of 90 degrees onto each other results
   in fibers with various effective lengths. For the study, various
   prototypes of gas inlets with different inlet geometries have been
   designed, manufactured and evaluated regarding their gas transfer rates.
   Results: The different designs resulted in the aimed flow profiles
   during the flow visualization. Selected prototypes have been tested with
   blood and the gas transfer rates have been determined. However, the
   modified designs with improved gas flow properties do not significantly
   impact the gas transfer rates measured with blood. Discussion: Two
   possible explanations can be derived from the results which may be
   tested in the course of further studies. Firstly, it is possible that
   the current gas inlet is already sufficiently adapted to the cylindrical
   blood flow geometry and fibers of different effective length. Secondly,
   it could be considered that side parameters such as the diffusive
   transfer of water vapour from the blood side to the gas side have a
   superseding influence on the gas flow profile. In conclusion, the gas
   transfer rates cannot be significantly increased by manipulating the gas
   flow profile through the fiber bundle. Nevertheless, the blood gas
   exchanger achieves already comparable transfer rates to products on the
   market but has reduced PMP membrane surface.
   Objectives: Throughout the history of medical devices, highly invasive
   systems underwent a series of generations prior a successful
   establishment as a widely accepted therapy. The only available THA today
   (SynCardia TAH) is successfully saving lives but comes with a
   significant restriction of the quality of life (QoL) and a
   stigmatization of the patients. According to surgeons this is an
   important factor contributing to the low number of implantations today.
   Methods: Next generation devices using an implanted drive promise a new
   level of QoL and are currently developed by several institutions
   worldwide. Reasons for the long time to market of the next TAH
   generation (>15 years) might be found in the enormous challenges of
   technological aspects together with a difficult marked situation from an
   investors point of view. However, a higher QoL and an increasing trust
   in the reliability of the next TAH generations will inherently lead to a
   higher number of implantations, and further the acceptance of these
   devices towards an established therapy option. Results: The approach of
   the ReinHeart TAH is to adopt the well-proven hydraulic features of the
   SynCardia TAH while improving its current limitations. The ReinHeart TAH
   features a passive filling during diastole, a principal that is also
   successfully applied by the SynCardia TAH. The simple and robust linear
   driving mechanism allows for a compact design, achieving fit in the vast
   majority of patients. Beyond that, the drive principle makes additional
   sensors unnecessary. The compact, smart and usability-driven design of
   the external components will lead to a broad acceptance by the patients.
   Discussion: The unique features of the ReinHeart TAH elevate TAH-therapy
   to the next evolutionary step with regards to robust long-term
   application, size, ease of use and quality of life.
   Objectives: Circulating endothelial cells can be used to diagnose
   cardiovascular diseases. However, their concentration in the blood is
   very low (<100 per ml). A large volume of blood is needed, which should
   not be drawn from the patient. Instead a probe is inserted into the
   bloodstream of the patient to isolate as many cells as possible. The
   geometry of the cell probe is one of the key factors affecting cell
   deposition because its shape influences the flow conditions along the
   cell probe. The aim of this combined in vitro and in silico study is to
   find out the optimal flow conditions for cell deposition aiming to
   develop in future novel optimal cell probe shape. Methods: In vitro
   experiments in a closed loop with endothelial cells from HUVEC cell line
   were carried out and the cell deposition as a function of the probe
   shape (4 probe types) and five different flow rates were investigated.
   The knowledge of the flow conditions at the cell probe was obtained by
   flow simulations by using CFD software STAR CCM+. By combining the
   experimental and simulation data with an iterative procedure, wall shear
   stresses, which seems to promote cell deposition, can be identified.
   Results: It could be shown that the geometry of the cell probe has a
   much greater influence on cell deposition than the flow rates in the
   blood vessel. Wall shear stress around 0.4 Pa seems to be responsible
   for the optimal deposition of endothelial cells. However, this flow
   condition does not correlate with all flow rate experiments. Discussion:
   The results of the combined in vitro - in silico study on deposition of
   endothelial cells on the existing cell probe design are promising.
   However, the used in vitro set up does not allow to extract maximal
   information from each test and should be redesigned.
   Objectives: The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) consists of the
   pump, driveline and peripherals, all of which are potentially subject to
   failure. According to the recent research only 13\% of failures were due
   to the pump itself, while over 60\% were due to batteries, controllers
   and peripheral cables. Taking into account usability factors we present
   a novel control unit for the rotary blood pumps aimed to decrease LVAD
   malfunction. Methods: The pump motor windings are leaded out by doubled
   wires (six total) via driveline to the extracorporeal splitter where the
   driveline is divided by two ways. Each way consists of three pump motor
   phase signals and three current sense signals from the other way. The
   two identical control units with integrated rechargeable batteries are
   connected to each way of the splitter simultaneously. This symmetrical
   peripherals architecture allows each control unit to drive the pump (in
   the active mode) or sense the parameters from the parallel way (in the
   passive mode). The control is based on the field oriented control method
   that allows the passive unit to continuously monitor the direction and
   magnitude of the magnetic field vector in the pump, which is created by
   the active unit and, upon loss of control, immediately begins to
   generate control signals with the necessary amplitude and phase. In case
   of mismatch of the parameters in any control units, alarms are to occur.
   Results: Novel Sputnik LVAD was developed according to the described
   philosophy. This LVAD system has a backup feature which covers almost
   all peripherals including driveline, control system and battery. In case
   of the single fault condition in the peripherals the system continues to
   drive the pump with pause in the control less than 4 ms. Discussion:
   Developed peripherals integrated in the LVAD allow reducing the risk of
   the device malfunction and improving usability.
   Objectives: Polysaccharides belong to the most abundant biomaterials on
   earth. They form structural elements of plant and animal tissues, but
   many of them have also important regulatory functions towards cells,
   tissues and organs. Glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and other carboxylated and
   sulfated polysaccharides possess a bioactivity that is due to their high
   affinity to a plethora of proteins forming insoluble and soluble
   components of cell environments, but also direct interaction with cell
   receptors. Methods: Making surface coatings for implants from natural or
   semisynthetic GAG that guide cell behavior requires different strategies
   of covalent or physical attachment. Simple covalent binding mechanisms
   can be based on oxidation of pendant hydroxyl groups of monosaccharide
   subunits or introduction of reactive side groups like thiols that permit
   direct coupling to surfaces. Results: Physical can exploit the inherent
   charge of these molecules that permits formation of multilayers kept
   together by ion pairing, but also intrinsic cross-linking of activated
   GAG. Both mechanism can be also used to form 3D structures as
   biocompatible in situ gelling hydrogels that permit embedding of growth
   factors and cells. Discussion: These 2D and 3D systems are instructive
   controlling cell spreading, growth and differentiation, which will be
   shown with examples on chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation of
   mesenchymal stem and other cells.
   Objectives: A successful creation and adequate maturation of
   arteriovenous fistula (AVF) provides efficient treatment and long term
   patient survival. The aim of the study was to determine the predictors
   for primary failure of AVF, such as gender, age, AVF site of creation,
   and primary renal disease, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)
   stage 4/5. Methods: The medical records of 178 created arteriovenous
   fistulae in patients with CKD stage 4/5, in a single center for the year
   2018, were retrospectively studied. Primary failure of AVF was defined
   as thrombosis or inability for cannulation of the fistula within 3
   months of creation. Early thrombosis of AVF was defined as an immediate
   failure due to thrombosis of the fistula within 24 hours of creation.
   Adequate maturation of AVF was defined as successful cannulation of AVF
   for efficient HD. Results: The mean age of the patients was 59.75 +/-
   14.65 years, and 65.16\% (116/178) were men. Adequate maturation of
   fistulae was achieved in 83.71\% (149/178). Primary failure of AVF
   occurred in 16.29\% (29/178) of the created fistulae, while 10.11\%
   (18/178) had early thrombosis. Distal AVF (radio-cephalic) was the
   dominant site with 38.76\% (69/178) of the created fistulae, followed by
   middle-arm AVF (radio-cephalic) site in 32.02\% (57/178) and proximal
   AVF (brachio-basilic) site in 29.22\% (52/178) of the created fistulae.
   The distal fistulae were significantly more frequently created in male
   patients (51 vs 18; p=0,015). The female patients were significantly
   older than the male patients (63.27 vs 57.86 years; p=0,018). The
   patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) were significantly older than the
   non-DM patients (63.65 vs 58.05 years; p=0,018). Discussion: Hospital
   strategy for creation of a permanent vascular access for hemodialysis is
   an ``Arteriovenous fistula first{''}. The female gender was more
   frequently associated with primary failure of AVF, while age, AVF
   creation site, and primary renal disease were not.
   Objectives: Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and its co-polymer with
   trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE) demonstrating biocompatibility and
   piezoelectric property are among the most promising biomaterials for
   nerve regeneration. Their blends with polydiphenylene phthalide (PDP)
   can improve nerve tissue regeneration due to combined electrical
   switching effect of PDP. Methods: Electrospinning and film casting were
   used to produce porous electrospun fibre mats and thin films,
   respectively. SEM, DSC, RAMAN and FTIR spectroscopy, as well as
   piezoelectric measurements were performed to analyse morphology and
   physical-chemical properties of initial and final materials. A special
   measuring cell was designed to conduct dielectric spectroscopy
   measurements on samples with both deposited and pressed contacts.
   Results: Electrospun PVDF-TrFE and PVDF-TrFE+PDP fibre mats and casted
   PVDF-TrFE, PVDF, PVDF-TrFE+PDP film samples were produced. The range of
   fibre diameter of 0.5-1.2 mu m was obtained from SEM images. RAMAN
   (500-3500 cm(-1)) and FTIR (600-2000 cm(-1)) spectra were obtained for
   initial and final materials. The dependence of the samples capacity on
   the uniaxial pressure was measured. The frequency dependence of the
   capacitance and tangent of the dielectric loss angle tg(delta) at a
   constant uniaxial pressure has also been analysed. Discussion: RAMAN
   spectrum of PDP+PVDF-TrFE fibre mats contains peaks from PDP and
   PVDF-TrFE, indicating that electrospinning method is suitable to produce
   PDP-containing PVDF-TrFE materials. Results of dielectric measurements
   showed that the presence of TrFE in co-polymer significantly reduces the
   value of the samples' capacitance. The capacitance of fibrous samples is
   much lower than that of films due to high porosity of fibre mats
   (>90\%). TrFE-containing samples demonstrate high dielectric losses at
   low frequencies. The combined analysis of dielectric and piezoelectric
   properties is ongoing.
   Objectives: The objective of this study is the development of a magnetic
   levitation system of a new type of blood pump. A fully magnetically
   levitated plate is oscillating in a trapezoidal shaped pump housing to
   create a relatively blood gentle flow. The oscillating movement of the
   plate is realized with a combination of a driven harmonic oscillator and
   a 1-degree-of-freedom magnetic levitation system. Methods: Multiple
   design concepts utilizing different electromagnetic principles were 3D
   modelled with Solid Works and imported into Ansys Mawell 3D to execute
   electromagnetic FEM simulations. Based on the results, the most suitable
   concept was selected by means of electromagnetic performance, stability,
   use of space and general feasibility. A PID-controller was implemented
   using Matlab/Simulink. The feasibility and stability of the concept was
   tested on a full-scale prototype. Results: The prototype demonstrates
   the feasibility and stability of the concept. The stabilization of the
   plate can be realized with an electric current that is about 7 times
   lower than bearable for the electromagnetic coils of the first
   prototype, allowing further miniaturization of future prototypes.
   Discussion: Though the general feasibility of the concept could be
   demonstrated, tests of the pumping performances are still pending to
   evaluate the suitability of the pump as an implantable blood pump.
   Objectives: Long term survival rate after the resection for the
   esophageal carcinoma has not been satisfactory. One of the most
   important topics in the area of the esophageal cancer is the
   reconstruction of the esophageal tract. If the artificial esophagus can
   be constructed, this technology will be beneficial for patients with
   esophageal cancer in the advanced stage. Methods: In the previous
   reports, artificial esophagus with shape memory (SMA) alloy actuator had
   been reported. However, total occlusion of the esophageal tract had been
   difficult. In this study, Origami engineering technology had been used
   for the peristaltic motion. Triangle shape of the Origami structure had
   been designed in this study for the total occlusion of the esophageal
   tracts to prevent the gastroesophageal reflux. The corner of the
   triangle had been pulled by SMA actuators following the diagonal lines
   for the folding power. Results: In the design concept of this artificial
   esophagus, the artificial esophageal tracts will be sutured to the
   human's esophagus. In this stage, the artificial esophageal tracts were
   consisted by the artificial vessel's material, and in the next stage
   regenerative esophagus will be the candidates. Esophageal tracts will be
   covered with triangle shape tracts with SMA actuator to embody the
   peristalsis. In the results in this study, total occlusion of the
   artificial esophageal tracts had been embodied by the use of the Origami
   structure. Through the arrangement of the triangle shape origami
   structures, co-driving will be embodied for the peristalsis function.
   Discussion: Until now, there had been no success in achieving
   peristalsis motion of the artificial esophagus. For the application of
   the human esophageal tracts, more study is necessary. This study was the
   first step for the application of the new artificial esophagus in the
   world for the achievement of the totally occluded peristalsis.
   Objectives: The transplantation of human induced pluripotent stem cell
   (hiPSC)-derived grafts represents an alternative treatment option for
   post-myocardial infarction patients. So far, myocardial tissue
   engineering mainly focused on the generation of ventricular-like tissues
   providing sufficient contractile function. Atrial- and pacemaker-like
   cardiomyocytes (CMs) are hypothesized to have a negative effect on
   tissue function, as they could lead to a lower force development and to
   arrhythmias after transplantation, respectively. Therefore, we aim to
   characterize subtype composition in the differentiated CM cultures, as
   well as in generated tissues thereof and analyze tissue functionality.
   Methods: The hiPSC-CMs are then mixed with human fibroblasts and a
   matrix to generate bioartifical cardiac tissues (BCTs) using our
   established bioreactor technology. In order to assess the ratio of
   individual iPSC-derived CM subtypes, flow cytometry and
   immunofluorescence (IF) stainings with antibodies targeting
   subtype-specific markers (MLC2v, COUPTF-2, and MLC2a) were performed.
   Results: First results revealed a high percentage (80-90\%) of MLC2v
   positive cells in differentiated CM populations. The remaining cells
   stained positive for atrial markers (COUPTF-2, MLC2a). Functional
   measurements mainly focused on BCT contractility and showed forces
   similar to the native myocardium (6.5 mN/mm2). In addition, we observed
   that a higher proportion of ventricular-like CMs leads to higher
   contractile BCT function. Discussion: Taken together, these molecular
   and functional results reveal that our differentiation protocol led to
   the formation of mainly ventricular-like CMs and that BCTs generated
   thereof show typical characteristics of myocardial tissues. For future
   ventricular-like tissue replacement therapy, we aim to perform a risk
   assessment for ``contaminating{''} cardiac cell types with respect to
   both BCT function and arrhythmias.
   Objectives: Standardized hemolysis tests according to ASTM F1841-97
   (2017) are the current gold standard for hemolysis evaluation. As part
   of the standard flow loop, a screw clamp is used to regulate the flow
   resistance in the circulations. Especially with extracorporeal pumps
   used for lung support, cardiopulmonary bypass application, or
   C0(2)-Removal, resistance has to maintain a pressure gradient of more
   than 500 mmHg. As a consequence, the screw clamp itself turns into a
   critical hemolysis hotspot, possibly overlying and biasing the hemolysis
   caused by the tested pump. Therefore, we present an alternative
   resistance causing only low hemolysis and at the same time maintaining
   ASTM testing specifications. Methods: We developed one novel resistance
   and evaluated the hemolysis potential of the novel and one alternative
   in flow loops. The flow loops were set up according to the ASTM standard
   with three identical pumps (Deltastream (R) DP3, Medos AG), two with the
   novel and alternative resistances each and one with the state-of-the art
   resistance, the screw clamp. The loops were set to high pressure
   conditions present in cardiopulmonary bypass applications, ECMO or
   C0(2)-Removal. The loops operated for 6 hours with porcine blood (n =
   6). Blood samples were drawn hourly and free plasma hemoglobin was
   evaluated by means of photometric measurement. Results: A new resistance
   for ASTM pump evaluation at high pressure regimes with little impact on
   hemolysis was developed. The resistance is easy to integrate into the
   recirculation loop and can be adjusted continuously. In-vitro blood
   trials revealed lower hemolysis for the new resistance compared to the
   current gold standard. Discussion: Extracorporeal continuous flow blood
   pumps with transfemoral cannulation work against high pressure at low
   flow. Up to now, hemolysis evaluation of the pumps is biased by
   hemolysis caused by the flow loop resistance. Our newly designed
   resistance causes less hemolysis, thus allowing for more meaningful and
   reliable hemolysis test results.
   Objectives: To characterize the biological background of prothrombotic
   platelet function in the setting of durable Mechanical Circulatory
   Support (MCS) with Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs) and to
   evaluate influence of different antithrombotic regimens dictated by
   specific clinical needs. Methods: Platelet thrombin generation was
   quantified in 75 LVAD patients implanted with the HeartMate II (n=10,
   13\%), HeartMate 3 (n=27, 36\%), or HeartWare HVAD (n=38, 51\%) using
   the Platelet Activity State (PAS) Assay and the Thrombin Generation Test
   (TGT). Data was compared in patients managed with i) oral
   anticoagulation plus aspirin (n=46, 61\%) or ii) anticoagulation alone
   (n=29, 39\%) due to significant bleeding risk. Coagulation parameters
   (platelet count, International Normalized Ratio {[}INR], activated
   Partial Thromboplastin Time {[}aPTT], Fibrinogen and D-Dimers levels)
   and hemolysis index (lactate dehydrogenase levels, LDH) were also
   recorded to comprehensively characterize hemostatic profiles and actual
   prothrombotic risk in the two groups. Results: The PAS assay revealed
   low-intensity increase in platelet prothrombinase activity in patients
   without aspirin (1.13-fold higher; p=0.04). Similarly, the TGT revealed
   moderate higher platelet reactivity in patients not on aspirin,
   consistent with reduction of lag time (0.87-fold lower; p<0.001),
   increase in peak of thrombin generation (1.5-fold higher; p=0.002) and
   thrombin generation rate (2-fold higher; p=0.01), but comparable
   endogenous thrombin potential (p>0.05). Coagulation parameters and LDH
   levels were not different in these two groups (p>0.05). Discussion: In
   patients with a durable MCS, aspirin minimally modulates the biochemical
   pathway of platelet thrombin generation. Re-evaluation of antithrombotic
   management criteria in selected patients stratified according to
   bleeding risk might significantly reduce LVAD hemcompatibility-related
   adverse events.
   Objectives: To determine the value of post-reperfusion kidney biopsyin
   predicting renal function and the incidence rate of DGF in deceased
   donor renal transplant recipients within 1 year after the surgery.
   Methods: We retrospectively included 461 patients who accepted the
   donation after the death of citizen at our center. According to the
   Remuzzi criteria, we compared the pathological biopsy and graft outcome
   between right and left donor kidneys from the same donor.Remuzzi score 
   pound 3 was divided into low group, 4-6 middle group, > 6 high group.
   The incidence of delayed graft function (DGF), acute rejection (AR) and
   renal function within 1 year after surgery was observed. A multivariate
   analysis was conducted on the risk factors of kidney function and DGF
   incidence. Results: Of the 461 recipients,458 recipients have good graft
   function and 3 grafts failed. The reperfusion kidney biopsy, the
   incidence of graft DGF and renal function at each time point after
   transplantation between the left and right kidneys from the same donor
   were same (p>0.05). 88.1\% was in low group, 10.4\% in middle group, and
   1.5\% in high group. The incidence of DGF and the eGFR in different time
   points after transplantation were different (p<0.05). Multivariate
   analysis revealed that last creatinine before acquisition and Remuzzi
   score were independent predictors of DGF after transplantation (p<0.05).
   Vascular scores were independent risk factors affecting renal function
   at 1 year after transplantation(p<0.05) Discussion: The reperfusion
   renal allograft biopsy can reflect the donor's baseline data and predict
   early renal function after transplantation. Renal vascular disease may
   be an independent predictor of poor prognosis of the graft.
   The ongoing development of modern manufacturing processes, as well as
   the automation and cross-linking of production facilities opens up new
   freedoms for the individualized manufacturing of medical devices. The
   patient-specific design of these highly loaded devices is associated
   with a high degree of experience on the part of the designer. The
   assessment of the safety and performance of these `` lot size 1
   products{''} cannot be carried out economically by mechanical testing.
   This results in a verification gap in the product life cycle of
   patient-specific medical devices. A verification of the design and thus
   the evaluation of the function and safety of the products can only be
   carried out economically with the help of automated numerical
   simulations. A software to perform virtual strength assessment of custom
   implants was developed. The lecture shows how the verification process
   of patient-individual designs with numerical methods, can contribute to
   the increase of patient safety. In addition, the integration and
   documentation of numerical simulations within the product life cycle
   will be presented using industrial examples.
   Objectives: One of the most pressing issues of regenerative medicine is
   the fabrication of constructs with defined parameters in order to create
   conditions for proper cell adhesion and proliferation that will be close
   to native tissue conditions. An application utilizing the
   electrospinning method may potentially solve this problem. The main goal
   of this study was to fabricate electrospun scaffolds based on silk
   fibroin and to characterize their properties. Methods: Silk fibroin
   scaffolds were obtained by electrospinning method. There were two types
   of scaffolds: 1) silk fibroin scaffolds, 2) silk fibroin scaffolds with
   addition of 30 per cent of gelatin by mass. Scaffold structure was
   investigated by scanning electron microscopy and scanning probe
   nanotomography. Cell adhesion and proliferation were investigated in
   mice fibroblasts 3T3 model. The regenerative potential of scaffolds was
   estimated in a model of Wistar rat full-thickness skin wound
   regeneration. Results: The electrospun scaffolds have fibrous porous
   structure with an average fiber thickness 300-600 nm. Both types of
   scaffolds are biocompatible in vitro. Presence of gelatin in scaffold
   composition improves cell proliferation. Scaffolds promote skin wound
   regeneration and restore native skin structure. Histological analysis
   did not evolve inflammatory process. Discussion: Electrospinning is a
   promising method to obtain fibrous biomimetic constructs with defined
   properties. The biocompatibility of produced constructs was shown in
   vitro and in vivo. Both types of scaffolds have a significant
   regenerative potential and are prospects for different fields of
   regenerative medicine.
   Objectives: Biodegradable PCL-based electrospun scaffolds are often used
   in TE. However, such scaffolds lack biocompatibility, wettability and
   chemical accessibility for tendon replacement applications. Here, we
   propose a new method to overcome those shortcomings by using
   PCL:Chitosan-graft-PCL (PCL:CS-g-PCL) blends instead of post-process
   coatings. Methods: Blended solutions of PCL (175 mg/ml in 2,2,2-TFE) and
   CS-g-PCL (1200 mg/ml in chloroform) were electrospun into scaffolds with
   CS-g-PCL from 0 to 90 wt\% (10 ratios). SEM based measurements were
   carried out to investigate fiber diameter and morphology. Chitosan amino
   groups within the fibers were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy (H-1-NMR) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). DSC
   measurements were conducted to assess thermal properties and
   crystallinity. Subsequently, metabolic activity of human mesenchymal
   stromal cells (hMSC) seeded on the scaffolds, was determined over 7
   days. Results: Blends with CS-g-PCL contents < 90 wt\% led to fiber
   diameter of 1 +/- 0.35 mu m and to 2 +/- 0.38 mu m for 90 wt\%. XPS
   measurements showed an enrichment of chitosan amino groups at the
   surface of the fibers. The enthalpy of fusion increased by up to 40 J/g
   for CS-g-PCL contents from 0 to 90 wt\%, indicating a significant
   increase in crystallinity. hMSCs had maximum metabolic activity on
   samples with CS-g-PCL contents between 10 and 30 wt\%. Discussion:
   Electrospinning of blended PCL:CS-g-PCL solutions resulted in higher
   crystallinity while preserving mechanical properties. Furthermore,
   increased wettability improved biocompatibility and chemical
   accessibility, which ultimately influenced the metabolic activity of the
   hMSCs positively. This promising novel approach will increase the
   biocompatibility of PCL-based scaffolds with simultaneous reduction in
   production complexity.
   Objectives: Biventricular assist device (BVAD) is reported to be used in
   3-5\% of continuous-flow VAD (cf-VAD). Our recent strategy is to
   stabilize INTERMACS profile 1 or unstable profile 2 patients by
   paracorporeal VAD, central ECMO or IABP before proceeding to cf-VAD.
   Patients with RV failure are also aggressively treated by PDE-5
   inhibitors or endothelin receptor antagonist at the outpatient clinic
   after implant. We examined validity of this strategy by analyzing BVAD
   necessity and patient survival. All cf-VAD was used for bridge to
   transplantation. Average waiting time for heart transplantation is
   nearly 3.5 years in our country. Methods: 166 consecutive patients were
   implanted with cf-VAD. DCM was seen in 113, ICM in 14, dHCM in 12,
   post-myocarditis CM in 6, ARVC in 3, RCM in 3 and others in 15. 130
   patients underwent primary cf-LVAD implantation. Pre-implant profiles of
   those patients were 2 in 62, 3 in 62 and 4 in 6. 36 patients were
   converted from another type of mechanical circulatory support (MCS).
   Actuarial survival was calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and
   comparisons were made using Log-rank method. Results: No patient
   required RVAD at the time of implantation nor late after implantation.
   Average support duration was 787 days, and 53 patients were on the
   support longer than 3 years. During follow-up 56 patients reached
   transplantation, 9 weaned from VAD due to functional recovery and 80
   on-going support. 1-, 2-, 3-year survival of 166 patients was 92.8\%,
   89.5\% and 85.9\%. There were no statistical differences between
   subgroups, such as sex, pre-implant profile, body size and primary/redo
   sternotomy. Discussion: We successfully implanted cf-LVAD and managed in
   the outpatient clinic without RVAD support in 166 consecutive patients,
   including those who were severely ill in the pre-implant stage. Our
   strategy for stabilizing profile 1 and unstable profile 2 patients by
   other types of MCS and aggressive use of PDE-5 inhibitors or endothelin
   receptor antagonist seemed to be safe and effective.
   Objectives: Recently, composite bionanomaterials containing biological
   materials and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been actively studied. CNTs
   may contain catalytic ferromagnetic nanoparticles and they can affect
   the properties of the composite bionanomaterial. To the study of this
   issue, we paid attention. The object of the study was a composite
   nanomaterial consisting of bovine serum albumin (BSA - matrix) and
   single-walled CNT (SWCNT - filler). Methods: Aqueous dispersion in the
   composition of 20 wt.\% BSA and 0.01 wt.\%. SWCNTs were prepared using
   traditional nanotechnology methods (thorough mixing, ultrasonic
   homogenization, decanting, etc.). The optical density of dispersion was
   measured after a magnetic field gradient ( 1 T/m) was applied to it for
   100 hours. The obtained values were compared with the optical dispersion
   density in the absence of a magnetic field. Recent samples were
   considered control. Results: It was found that under the action of a
   magnetic field, the optical density of the water dispersion of BSA/SWCNT
   in the region of 300 divided by 800 nm decreases by > 10\% relative to
   control samples. Additionally, it was found that under the action of a
   magnetic field, the optical density of the aqueous dispersion of
   BSA/SWCNT decreases by > 10\% relative to control samples. Discussion:
   The decrease in the optical dispersion density of BSA/SWCNT is caused by
   the deposition of nanotubes on the cell surface under the action of a
   magnetic field gradient. It is assumed that the single walled carbon
   nanotubes contain catalytic ferromagnetic nanoparticles. Estimates
   showed that in bionanomaterial at a level with concentrations > 0.0001
   wt.\% CNT nanotubes can be fixed with modern sensors of a weak magnetic
   field with a threshold sensitivity of <= 1 pT. It was concluded that
   changes in implants in the BSA/SWCNT composite bionanomaterials can be
   observed non-invasively with the help of weak magnetic field sensors
   (for example, SQUID or CMFS).
   Objectives: Recent developments in imaging technology have enabled
   cryobiologists to reveal some mechanisms employed by nature to cope with
   freezing stress. The systematic study of these mechanisms may prove
   useful for developing ultimately novel and efficient cryopreservation
   protocols. In this work, we examine the potential advantages of using
   infrared video thermography (IVT) for monitoring latent heat release and
   freeze-thaw events in 3D porous collagen-hydroxyapatite scaffolds used
   as a model system. In this context, we present ongoing results on the
   identification of warm ice-nucleating agents (INA) from Hippophae
   rhamnoides with potential use in cryopreservation of tissue-engineered
   constructs (TECs). Methods: The scaffolds were prepared by freeze-drying
   of mineralized collagen suspensions and characterized by Raman
   microscopy, X-ray microcomputed tomography and differential scanning
   calorimetry. Visualization of freezing/thawing events in scaffolds
   frozen with and without cryoprotective solutions based on leaf
   homogenate from Hippophae rhamnoides was performed using the
   thermography-based platform developed at the University of Thessaly.
   Results: Scaffolds presented 3D porous architecture and characteristic
   RAMAN peaks of collagen type I and hydroxyapatite (HAP). Presence of HAP
   decreased the specific heat capacity of collagen scaffolds. The
   probability of ice nucleation was higher in cryoptotective solutions
   with scaffolds than in solutions without. The ice nucleation temperature
   within scaffolds using INA was determined to be around -1.5 degrees C.
   Discussion: IVT proved to be a very effective approach for visualizing
   latent heat release and freeze-thaw events within scaffolds frozen in
   cell culture plates. INA from Hippophae rhamnoides may potentially be
   used for prevention of supercoiling in cryopreservation. The results
   obtained could serve as a basis for further development of efficient
   cryopreservation protocols for 3D TECs.
   Objectives: In the development process of heart assist devices,
   numerical simulations become more and more essential. The variety of
   applications comprises different types of cannulas or flow geometries of
   ventricular assist devices (VADs). The analysis of the flow field inside
   VADs by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is extremely useful.
   Numerical parameter studies allow the treatment of several device
   related problems in conjunction with a well-balanced cost-benefit ratio.
   Methods: Results obtained from properly performed CFD calculations
   permit the determination of flow induced blood damage of new flow
   designs in VADs and enable the prediction of the risk of harmful
   hemolysis for the patient. The literature provides different models for
   blood cell damages. In application, a proper definition of acceptable
   thresholds is required, in order to optimize blood guiding geometries as
   rotor blades or diffusor shapes in VADs. Another application of CFD can
   be found in the field of flow path optimization of new cannula designs.
   Corresponding results can lead to various design changes and can
   significantly contribute to a comprehensive risk analysis for regulatory
   assessment. Results: Based on the numerical results, geometrical design
   iterations can considerably improve the flow design of blood pumps and
   cannulas. Thoroughly optimized designs exert reduced shear stresses to
   the cells and create less damage to the patient's blood. Furthermore,
   CFD studies can provide valuable information in the process of risk
   analysis during the regulatory assessment of heart assist devices and
   support the interpretation of experimental in-vitro investigations.
   Discussion: Although numerical simulations represent a commonly used
   tool during research and development in the field of heart assist
   devices, the introduction of strict requirements and well-defined
   guidelines would considerably simplify the implementation of numerical
   studies for regulatory approval and enhance the comparability of
   independently gained results.
   Objectives: Current standards in cryopreservation for biomedical
   technology are still based on slow freezing processes inducing
   crystallization within the sample. In preparation for this
   cryopreservation regime, cells and tissues are detached from growth
   surfaces and dissociated into single cell suspensions. Existing
   infrastructures like freezing devices, lab ware, and liquid nitrogen
   tanks for long-term storage, are designed for the handling of suspended
   cells and tissues and for stock keeping purposes, these procedures
   usually are efficient enough. Through the addition of cryoprotective
   agents, the sample can cope with the emerging damaging mechanism
   resulting from ice crystal formation. However, diagnostically and
   therapeutically relevant cell systems, e.g. human induced pluripotent
   stem cells (hiPSCs) or their derivates like neuronal cells, depend on
   cell-cell and cell-surface interactions mediated by cytoskeletal
   proteins. Their structures are disordered, either due to these
   preparatory dissociating steps or due to crystallization, resulting in
   loss of functionality or cell loss in general. Methods: A second
   cryopreservation regime, the vitrification, avoids crystallization
   within the sample and thus avoids the occurring damaging mechanisms
   (e.g. shear forces, osmotic shock). Thereby, the structure of cells and
   tissues is preserved, leading to viable and functional cells even in
   their adherent state (with cell-cell and cell-surface contacts) after
   thawing. However, vitrification requires a skilled handling and so far,
   the infrastructure has not been established to enable routine
   vitrification workflows for large cell numbers. Results and Discussion:
   Our work shows the potential and capacity of vitrification on different
   cell types (e.g. hiPSCs, dopaminergic neurons). We demonstrate that
   vitrification is superior to slow freezing regarding cell loss and
   functionality and holds the possibility to cryopreserve scalable and
   ready-to-use cell products for a broad range of biomedical research.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is to characterize the decellularized
   human chorion membrane (dHCM) and to study its suitability as a
   substrate to model biological barriers. Methods: HCMs were submitted to
   a chemical and physical decellularization process. The decellularization
   protocol was optimized by quantifying and analyzing the presence and
   distribution of cell nuclei and dsDNA by DAPI staining, PicoGreen and
   electrophoresis. The dHCM was characterized by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), immunohistochemistry, Dot-Blot, SDS-PAGE, and GAGs and
   Collagen quantification. Moreover, dHCM's mechanical properties were
   assessed and biocompatibility tests (metabolic and proliferation assays)
   with an endothelial human cell line (EA.hy.926) were performed. Results:
   The decellularization process of the HCM was successful, since the
   presence of nuclei was not observed, the amount of dsDNA was around 10
   ng/mg of dry tissue, and the DNA fragments had less than 200 bp. A
   compact membrane that preserved the HCM's reticular layer and basement
   membrane was obtained. SEM images revealed that dHCM is a substrate with
   two different surfaces: one composed by nanofibers and the other (in
   trophoblast layer's side) covered by a thin compact layer (basement
   membrane). In tissue sections it was possible to verify the presence of
   collagen type I and IV, fibronectin and laminin in both dHCM and native
   tissue. Corroborating these results higher molecular weight species were
   preserved in dHCM (SDS-PAGE). Additionally, dHCM's mechanical properties
   were determined: young's modulus of 5.9 MPa and ultimate tensile
   strength of 5.3 MPa. Differences in metabolic activity and cell
   proliferation were observed between both sides of the dHCM. Discussion:
   dHCM retained the main proteins of the extracellular matrix. Cell
   proliferation and viability were higher in the side of dHCM that
   preserved the basement membrane. dHCM's physical and mechanical
   properties make it a suitable substrate to mimic biological barriers.
   Objectives: Cryogels with improved non-fouling and cell adhesive surface
   properties were investigated as potential cell scaffold for BAL purpose.
   Cryogel monolith columns were used by other groups to fill the
   bioreactor chamber. However, device performance was not maintained for
   more than a few hours. Fluid dynamic measurements using a purpose-built
   mu PIV setup with video post-processing were conducted in order to
   extrapolate the effect of flow inside the cryogel matrix to improve cell
   viability and avoid blood cell activation. Starting from PIV results, a
   multi-layered bioreactor composed of spaced cryogel discs was developed
   to maximise blood/hepatocyte mass-exchange. This study aimed to
   investigate whether the multi-layered design results in improved
   performance compared to the column version in terms of hepatocytes
   viability and functionality. Methods: p(HEMA-co-MBA) cryogels were
   synthesised by cryogelation technique. Cryogels were then functionalised
   with alginate and RGD peptide and synthesised by solid phase method.
   Porous structure was analysed with SEM, confocal imaging and mu CT.
   Non-fouling properties were investigated by protein absorption studies.
   Cell viability was assessed by MTT/ATP activity and live/dead imaging.
   Hepatocyte functionality in bioreactors was investigated by
   quantification of albumin and urea production using ELISA and
   colorimetric assay, respectively, over time. Results: Synthesised
   cryogels possessed an open porosity with pore sizes of up to 100 mu m
   and an interconnected network of pores. Alginate helped preventing
   protein absorption from plasma. RGD peptide enhanced hepatocyte
   functionality. Cryogel perfused bioreactors maintained hepatocytes
   viability and functionality for up to 1 week. Discussion: Multi-layered
   bioreactor design showed a significantly higher production of albumin
   and urea compared to the column version, suggesting an improved mass
   exchange between medium and cells. Also cell colonization and
   proliferation through the device were improved.
   Objectives: Placental complex, including placental tissues, foetal
   membranes, and umbilical cord, is one of the most promising sources of a
   range of tissues and cells for clinical and experimental application in
   regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Certain components of
   placental material are already applied in medicine since decades, while
   others undergo intensive research and pre-clinical trials. Since
   placenta is a temporary organ, it provides the unique opportunity to
   obtain large amounts of tissues, including autologous, without the
   adverse effects to the donor. Moreover, great potential of placental
   multipotent stromal cells is recognized in generation of tissue
   engineered multicellular constructs. At the same time, clinical use and
   research proceedings are significantly restricted due to imperfections
   in storage technologies. Application of low-temperature preservation
   methods is especially challenging for 3-D multicellular structures, such
   as organs, tissues, and tissue engineered constructs. Methods: Here we
   aim to analyze the variety of cryoinjuries in a range of placental
   tissues and tissue engineered multicellular placental constructs, as
   well as support the cellular viability after low temperature storage. A
   range of cell and tissue culture as well as tissue engineering methods,
   cryomicroscopic analysis, evaluation of phenotypic and metabolic
   characteristics have been applied in this study. Results: Results have
   shown that the mechanisms of damage caused by cryopreservation
   procedures depend on particular structure of the studied object,
   peculiarities of intercellular bonds, as well as interaction with
   cryoprotective agents. At the same time, developed protocols allowed us
   to efficiently isolate viable cells after thawing of the studied
   tissues. Discussion: Conclusions of this study may lead to progress in
   improvement of biobanking technologies for tissues and tissue engineered
   multicellular constructs.
   Extracorporeal therapies, such as hemodialysis, apheresis or blood
   oxygenation, are only possible when recurrent blood access is feasible.
   Both, artificial grafts, e.g. made of polyethylene-terephthalate (Dacron
   (R)) or a fistula are not ideal models for that purpose and are commonly
   considered to represent the Achilles` Heel of extracorporeal blood
   circuits. A stable, implantable biologic vascular graft would be an
   ideal solution for the benefit of patients and many bioengineers are
   working on this dream to come true. When considering such a vascular
   graft to be used clinically and as a product to be sold in the medical
   device market, a series of problems with regard to approval have to be
   solved and some fundamental questions be answered. Regarding approval,
   current EU regulations refer to either the Medical Device Regulation
   (MDR) from 2017 or to Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products Regulation
   (ATMPs) from 2007. Under the premise ``Better safe than sorry!{''}
   regulations, such as MDR and ATMP, represent a European law. A
   bioengineered vascular graft is taken as a ``combination product{''}, as
   it is commonly made of biological cells and a (possibly) biodegradable
   scaffold material. When implanted, it would represent a high-risk class
   III medical device under the MDR regulation and would require a CE-mark.
   The ATMP regulation, however, says that a combination product has to be
   approved following the ``principal mode of action{''}. For products
   containing viable cells or tissues, a specific approach has been taken
   by the EU. For these products it holds true that ``whatever the role of
   the medical device, the pharmacological, immunological or metabolic
   action of these cells are considered to be the principal mode of
   action{''}. Under these premises, a combination product, such as a
   bioengineered vascular graft, is regulated under the ATMP rules, which
   renders approval rather complex. Consequences refer to the need of Phase
   I-III clinical trials including post-market surveillance
   Neuroengineering is a research area where engineering skills are used to
   solve basic and clinical problems in neuroscience. The aim of the
   presentation is to give an insight into neuroengineering applied in
   neurosurgery. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a method for reducing
   symptoms in movement disorders as Parkinson's disease and essential
   tremor. A thin electrode is surgically implanted with stereotactic
   technique at a well-defined brain structure. Our research focus on
   support systems for improving the surgical implantation procedure, and
   to increase the understanding of the DBS mechanism. A method for
   performing patient-specific simulations of the electric field around a
   DBS lead and map the data to the anatomy has been developed. The goal is
   to create improvement and side-disorder maps for the most common
   symptoms and brain targets used in DBS. Optics is another core area we
   apply in neurosurgery. Several optical probe systems for intraoperative
   guidance have been developed. Forward-looking probes can act as ``vessel
   alarm{''} by recording the tissue's microcirculation with laser Doppler
   flowmetry during creation of the brain trajectories in relation to
   stereotactic neurosurgery. In DBS this method has been evaluated in the
   clinical setting in more than 100 implantations. For brain tumor
   biopsies the method is presently introduced in combination with 5-ALA
   fluorescence measurements at the tumor border. 5-ALA induced
   fluorescence spectroscopy- and microscopy can also be used together in
   brain tumor surgery. Under the neurosurgical ``blue-light{''}
   microscope, a hand-held probe supports the surgeon by enhancing
   malignant tissue. Another challenge is optical monitoring of cerebral
   microcirculation in the neuro-intensive care setting. A prerequisite for
   successful project outcome is a close collaboration between biomedical
   engineers and neurosurgeons. difference.
   Objectives: The main goal of this study was to synthesize
   polysaccharide-based hydrogel systems that favor bone regeneration. The
   hydrogel formation is driven by Schiff base crosslinking reaction
   between the amino functionalities of carboxymethyl chitosan (CMChi) and
   the aldehyde groups of the different oxidized polysaccharides resulting
   in an imine bond formation. Methods: Different amounts of NaIO4 were
   used in order to oxidize Alginate (ALG) and Hyaluronic acid (HA),
   forming reactive dialdehyde derivatives with different oxidation
   degrees. The amount of aldehyde groups was determined by: A) using
   Schiff's reagent and detected by a UV-Vis spectrometer (550nm) and B)
   acid base titration after reacting the aldehyde groups with
   Hydroxylammoniumchloride. Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) was used
   for molecular weight determination of the different polysaccharides.
   Biocompatibility of the products was tested using Qblue (R) assay and
   CFDA staining. Results: Data obtained from both UV-VIS spectroscopy and
   titration show that the different polysaccharides have more aldehyde
   groups when high concentrations of NaIO4 were used and the reaction
   times were extended. The weight average molecular weights of all the
   products were lower after the oxidation step. Products with high
   oxidation degrees showed low biocompatibility. Discussion: ALG and HA
   with high oxidation degrees are required to prepare stable hydrogel
   systems and the dual utility of using CMChi and oxidized polysaccharides
   as both structural and bioactive component is promising for the
   formation of biocompatible hydrogel systems that can be used for bone
   tissue regeneration.
   Objectives: Xenotransplantation of transgenic porcine pancreatic islets
   offers a promising alternative source to circumvent current limitations
   posed by the scarcity of allogeneic donors. However, either immune
   rejection or oxygen supply in immune protected encapsulated islets
   remains a major concern. To decrease xenogeneic immune responses, we
   have investigated the feasibility to generate tissue engineered SLA
   silenced islet cell clusters (ICC) from alpha-Gal knock out, CD46, CD55
   and CD59 transgenic minipigs. Methods: Pancreatic islets single cell
   suspensions were generated by enzymatic digestion of porcine ICCs. The
   single cells were silenced for SLA class I and II by lentiviral vectors
   encoding for Nanoluciferase as reporter gene and for short hairpin RNAs
   targeting beta2-microglobulin (shb2m) or class II transactivator
   (shCIITA), respectively. SLA transcripts were evaluated by real-time PCR
   and protein levels by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy
   analyses. Cell death was evaluated by Propidium Iodide staining. The
   effect of SLA class I silencing was evaluated in human T and NK cell
   cytotoxicity assays. SLA-silenced pancreatic beta-cells were then used
   to form new ICCs in stirred bioreactors. Results: SLA class I silencing
   was designed to reach a level of up to 86\% and class II by up to 64\%
   on pancreatic islet cell monolayers. Silencing SLA expression did not
   affect cell viability and the insulin-producing beta-cell phenotype as
   indicated by Dithizone staining and levels of insulin production.
   Xenogeneic T-cell immune responses (p<0.05) as well as antibody-mediated
   cellular-dependent immune responses (p<0.01) were significantly
   decreased. Silencing SLA class I expression did not increase
   susceptibility to NK-cell cytotoxicity. In stirred bioreactors, tissue
   engineered islets showing the typical 3D-structure and morphology of ICC
   were assembled from SLA-silenced pancreatic cell suspensions to be used
   for transplantation in humanized mice as a first model. Discussion:
   These data shows the feasibility to generate low immunogenic porcine ICC
   from transgenic pigs after single cell engineering and post-
   transduction islet reassembling that might serve as a robust alternative
   to allogeneic pancreatic islet cell transplantation.
   Objectives: In patients with circulatory support, preload is a valuable
   clinical monitoring variable. While it is difficult to measure directly,
   it can be indirectly measured by PCWP or left atrial pressure (LAP).
   Typically, assessments of LAP require invasive methods. However,
   non-invasive estimation of LAP can be a useful tool for monitoring
   patients and adjusting pump speed to reduce the likelihood of hazardous
   events, such as ventricular suction and pulmonary congestion. This study
   presents an artificial neural network model estimating the LAP
   noninvasively across different patient conditions. Methods: LAP was
   estimated based on the HeartWare HVAD pump characteristics (current,
   flow and speed) derived from 186 experiments performed in a mock
   circulatory system with HVAD speed range from 1800 to 3600 rpm. The LAP
   estimation was evaluated by measuring the hemodynamic variables in
   response to a range of changes to the mock cardiovascular system,
   including changes in PVR, SVR and HR. A neural network was trained with
   70\% of the data (randomly chosen), and was validated and tested with
   the rest of data. The model performance was quantified by the mean
   squared error (MSE), correlation coefficient (r2) and Bland-Altman plot
   between measured and estimated LAP in different scenarios. Results: The
   neural network model was able to estimate LAP accurately using data
   collected in-vitro for training, validation and test sets. The MSE for
   all data is 1.36 mmHg, and correlation coefficients are 0.99, 0.91 and
   0.94 for training, validation and test sets, respectively. The
   Bland-Altman plot showed that error has a bias of 0.28 mmHg with a
   reproducibility coefficient of 2.2 mmHg. Discussion: The developed model
   would be useful for a real-time estimation of preload noninvasively
   which can be employed to adjust pump speed in heart-failure patients
   without inserting a pulmonary catheter into the pulmonary artery.
   Implementation of the developed estimator would also create a new
   physiological control system that can work noninvasively.
   Objectives: Blood vessels are integral to the maintenance of all
   tissues. They deliver oxygen and nutrients and remove waste. Blood
   vessels not only contain endothelial cells (ECs) that are in direct
   contact with flowing blood cells and fluids but they may also have
   pericytes and smooth muscle cells on the outside that stabilize and
   regulate their size. Defects in EC and pericyte/smooth muscle cell
   interaction are often implicated in many pathological conditions.
   Patients with a genetic disease called hereditary hemorrhagic
   telangiectasia (HHT) suffer from heavy and recurrent nosebleeds, due to
   unstable blood vessels as a result of defective interaction between ECs
   and pericytes. Methods: Here we used human induced pluripotent stem
   cells (hiPSCs) as a source of patient-specific cells, as they can be
   derived from all individuals, including children and patients with
   genetic disease and subsequently differentiated towards all cells of the
   body. Besides, we can now use hiPSCs to derive all the component of
   blood vessels in large numbers and use them to re-create blood vessels
   on a chip to model inflammation and disease. Results: HHT-hiPSC-ECs
   displayed no apparent functional differences using a set of standard
   two-dimensional (2D) assays. The ability of hiPSC-ECs to form a perfused
   microvascular network was next examined using three-dimensional (3D)
   cultures in microfluidic chips. Using these 3D vessels on a chip, we
   found that in contrast to 2D microvascular cultures, the ability to form
   3D microvessels in microfluidic chips was strikingly compromised when
   HHT-hiPSC-ECs were used compared to isogenic control ECs. Discussion:
   This patient-based hiPSC model thus serves as the first proof of
   principle that vascular diseases could be modeled using patient-specific
   hiPSCs in 3D microfluidic chips and to identify new target cells and
   possible pathways for therapy.
   Objectives: This study was aimed at fabricating various layer-by-layer
   (LbL) systems using glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) with the capability to
   bind BMP-2 specifically in order to control osteogenic differentiation
   of cells by biocompatible release systems. Methods: Heparin, chondroitin
   sulfate and their oxidized forms as polyanions were combined with
   chitosan and collagen I as polycations to form various multilayer
   coatings on model materials with the advantage of the intrinsic
   cross-linking formed between oxidized glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and
   polycations, improving multilayer stability and affecting the release of
   BMP-2. The myoblast cell line C2C12, which can differentiate into
   osteoblasts was seeded on 5 mu g/mL BMP-2 loaded multilayers. Cell
   viability, adhesion, osteogenic differentiation and BMP-2 release were
   investigated. Results: C2C12 cells cultured directly on the top of
   multilayers showed that particularly BMP-2 loaded multilayers made of
   oxidized GAGs promoted an osteogenic differentiation that was nearly
   comparable to the positive control, when 5 mu g/mL BMP-2 was added
   directly to the medium. Interestingly, the BMP-2 had synergistic effect
   on cell adhesion and spreading. BMP-2 in oxidized chondroitin sulfate
   multilayers was successfully loaded to the layers, sustainably released
   over time and affected cell differentiation more than the soluble BMP-2.
   Discussion: The results show that oxidized GAGs forming intrinsically
   cross-linked multilayers are useful as reservoirs for sustained release
   of BMP-2 in which the intrinsic cross-linking affected BMP-2 release,
   improved multilayers stability due to the resulting stiff surface
   compared to the native ones, supported cell adhesion, proliferation and
   subsequent differentiation. This can pave the way for coating implants
   and scaffolds for repair and regeneration of bone fractures.
   Objectives: Functional myocardial recovery during support with left
   ventricular assist devices (LVADs) is highly desirable but only observed
   in approx. 1\% of all patients. Previously, the more frequently
   implanted pulsatile blood pumps (PBPs) showed higher recovery rates than
   the currently used rotary blood pumps (RBPs). The aim of this study was
   to comparatively assess the capability of PBPs and RPBs to unload the
   left ventricle and restore physiological cardiac energetics in isolated
   hearts. Methods: An RBP (Medtronic HVAD) and a heartbeat synchronized
   PBP (BerlinHeart Excor) were alternately connected to eight isolated
   porcine hearts. To modulate the mode of LVAD support, RBP rotational
   speed was set to different support levels and ejection delay of the PBP
   was phased from 0\% to 90\%. Pressures, flows, left ventricular volumes,
   and myocardial oxygen consumption were recorded and cardiac efficiency
   quantified by the ratio of external work (EW) over myocardial oxygen
   consumption. Results: With increasing RBP support, lower left atrial
   pressures (LAP) were found to coincide with a decreased cardiac
   efficiency (r=0.91 +/- 0.12) with a median {[}inter quartile range]
   slope of 0.28 {[}0.91] \%/mmHg. In contrast, depending on the phase
   delay of ejection of a PBP, LAP and cardiac efficiency follow a
   sinusoidal course with the LAP minimum at 90\% and efficiency maximum at
   60\%. Discussion: In RBP support, aggressive ventricular unloading was
   found to lead to lower cardiac efficiencies. On the other side, phasing
   of a PBP offers the possibility to restore cardiac efficiency and
   simultaneously unload the ventricle. These results may justify future
   studies linking optimized cardiac mechanics and efficiency to functional
   recovery and reverse myocardial remodeling with LVAD therapy.
   Objectives: We focused on the interventricular dyssynchrony caused by
   the shortened systole of left ventricle (LV) compared to right ventricle
   (RV) during left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support. The purpose
   of this study was to assess and quantify the mechanical interventricular
   dyssynchorny according to the support condition using conductance
   catheter. Methods: We studied five goats with normal heart condition. A
   centrifugal LVAD was implanted under general anesthesia. We inserted the
   conductance catheter into the LV and RV and obtained the pressure-volume
   relationship. We defined the dyssynchronous status by the sign (plus or
   minus) of the LV volume (LVV) change is opposite to that of RV volume
   (RVV). (i.e., (dLVV/dt){*}(dRVV/dt)<0). Interventicular dyssynchrony
   (DYS) was quantified by calculating the percentage of time within the
   cardiac cycle. Bypass rate was set dividing the LVAD pump flow by the
   main pulmonary artery flow. We calculated the DYS under LVAD support
   with various bypass rate. Results: The mean DYS of normal heart, LVAD
   clamp, LVAD support with bypass rate of 50\%, 75 \% and 100\% were 6.0
   +/- 1.3, 8.6 +/- 2.6, 9.6 +/- 1.8, 15.5 +/- 5.6, and 24.6 +/- 8.6,
   respectively. Also, there was a higher linear negative correlation
   between LV stroke volume and DYS. Discussion: Interventricular
   dyssynchrony during LVAD support was assessed and quantified using
   conductance catheters. Dyssynchrony became significant when the LV was
   unloaded with high rotational speed under LVAD support. Assessment of
   influences for the right ventricular function and heart failure models
   will be studied in the further study.
   Objectives: (Bio)chemical modification of implants with drug delivery
   systems can support the body's natural healing capabilities by imitation
   of smooth tissue transitions along bone-tendon conjunctions. Modified
   interconnected 3D porous poly(epsilon-caprolactone) could act as a
   scaffold material for these implants. Methods: Cocontinuous blends of
   poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) were
   prepared by batch blending in an internal mixer. Annealing and leaching
   of the blends with water yielded the porous PCL scaffolds, which were
   then modified with chitosan (CS) grafted PCL (CS-g-PCL) via dip coating.
   Nanoparticle systems containing CS and tripolyphosphate (TPP) were
   obtained via ionotropic gelation. These CS-TPP nanoparticles (CSNPs) can
   be attached to the modified scaffolds via a Layer-by-Layer (LbL)
   deposition approach involving alginate (ALG). Results: Interconnected 3D
   porous PCL scaffolds with different morphologies have been prepared.
   Modification with CS-g-PCL, alginate, alginate fluorescein amine
   (ALG-FA), CS-TPP and fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled nanoparticles
   (CS-FITC-TPP) in a LbL approach was carried out. The blank scaffolds
   were analyzed in various ways, including via scanning electron
   microscopy and mercury intrusion porosimetry. Modified versions of the
   scaffolds were analyzed accordingly and the fluorescently labeled
   species were investigated via confocal laser scanning microscopy. CSNPs
   were loaded with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and layered on the modified
   scaffolds. Release of BSA from the scaffolds was investigated by
   ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy at 37 degrees C in phosphate-buffered
   saline (PBS). Discussion: Porous PCL scaffolds with different pore sizes
   and morphologies can be obtained via annealing and leaching of
   cocontinuous PCL/PEO blends. Surface modification with CS-g-PCL,
   alginate and CSNPs open up possibilities regarding graded implant
   fabrication.
   Objectives: Vascular calcification is accelerated and worsened in
   chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dialysis patients compared to the
   general population. Misbalanced phosphate and calcium metabolism plays
   an important role in this health burden in CKD. In this study the role
   of phosphate and calcium in inducing medial vascular calcification is
   researched. Methods: Rat aortic rings were incubated in the normal and
   calcifying mediums for seven days. Three independent experiments, three
   rings per condition in each, were performed (N=9). Normal medium
   consisted of DMEM with 0.9 mM phosphate and 1.8 mM calcium. Calcium
   medium (Ca) consisted of 4.0 mM calcium and 0.9 mM phosphate; phosphate
   medium (P) of 2.8 mM phosphate and 1.8 mM calcium; and calciumphosphate
   medium (Ca+P) of 4.0 mM calcium and 2.8 mM phosphate. Histochemical von
   Kossa staining was performed, and calcification area of a medial and
   adventitial section of the aorta was calculated. The results were
   compared using a two-way ANOVA test. Results: Von Kossa stainings and
   evaluations of the calcified area demonstrated increased calcification
   in aortic rings incubated in different calcification mediums, whereas
   the calcification takes part in different sections of the aorta. Calcium
   alone causes calcification in the adventitia, phosphate alone in the
   medial section of the aorta. Combination of both leads to extensive
   calcification in the adventitia and media. Discussion: In dialysis
   patients, serum calcium levels are maintained quite well, but serum
   phosphate levels may exceed suggested levels multiple times. The results
   of the study demonstrate that high phosphate level is the trigger of
   excessive vascular calcification and the control of levels of phosphate
   in CKD patients is crucially important.
   Objectives: Heterogeneously structured electrospun composite scaffolds
   have performed well as ECM-mimetic tissue replacements in recent years.
   In light of this, we present an assessment of amnion derived multipotent
   stromal cell (aMSC) growth on hybrid polycaprolactone(PCL)-gelatin(G)
   scaffolds in terms of viability, infiltration depth and metabolic
   activity. Methods: Four scaffold types were electrospun (150 mu m thick)
   with different PCL:G ratios and fibre diameter distributions using
   vertical (V) and horizontal (H) orientations - PCL175V (175 mg/ml,
   homogenous), PCL125G50H (125:50 mg/ml, homogeneous), PCL125G50V (125:50
   mg/ml, heterogeneous), PCL100G75V mg/ml (100:75 mg/ml, heterogeneous). A
   7 day live/dead assay and a 15 day infiltration study (depths measured
   using confocal laser scanning microscope) with aMSCs from Callithrix
   jacchus were performed. Metabolic activity was measured by MTT assay (7
   days). Additionally, gelatin loss during scaffold degradation (30 days)
   was measured by Raman spectroscopy. Results: In general, PCL-gelatin
   blends perform better than unblended PCL. PCL125G50V shows the deepest
   cell infiltration on all days (76.3 +/- 7.1 mu m by day 15). It is also
   the only sample that shows an increasing trend in metabolic activity
   from day 1 (0.0436 +/- 0.002) to day 7 (0.0996 +/- 0.009). Raman
   spectroscopy revealed a significant gelatin loss of 53.44 +/- 6.48 \% in
   PCL100G75V while PCL125G50V showed no significant loss by day 15.
   Discussion: A combination of heterogeneous fiber morphology and
   composite polymer content in electrospun scaffolds positively affects
   cell growth and infiltration. Considerable gelatin swelling during
   degradation can physically inhibit infiltrating cells. Therefore,
   choosing the right ratio of PCL:gelatin when designing such scaffolds is
   key.
   A total artificial heart is used for orthotopic replacement of the
   native ventricles in cases of irreversible biventricular heart failure
   resulting either from chronic dilated cardiomyopathy or fulminant acute
   myocardial infraction. It is essential to find the right indication.
   There are several surgical options to perform a total artificial heart
   operation. To prevent therapy-failure it essential to set the right
   indication for implanting a total artificial heart. In general therapy
   with a TAH is feasible with good postoperative results. Setting the
   right clinical frame is crucial for the establishment of a therapy
   concept.
   Objectives: Although diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage renal
   disease in many countries, data about its impact on patient-specific
   reaction to haemodialysis (HD) is scarce. Models that allow identifying
   and predicting patient-specific response to HD are in development and
   their improvement is encouraged by clinicians to obtain suitable
   decision support systems (DSS). Here, possible correlations between
   diabetes and alterations in the patient-specific parameters identified
   by a multi-pool, multi-solute model, developed in our laboratory, are
   investigated. Methods: Data acquired during the `DialysIS' Interreg
   Project (141 patients, 4 centres, 1276 HD) have been used. For each
   patient, a set of specific parameters was identified: one modulates the
   permeability at the capillary wall (rho), the others account for altered
   transport of catabolites and electrolytes at the cellular wall (k(i))
   and at the dialyser membrane (eta(i)), where `(i)' indicates different
   solutes. Patients have been classified as diabetic (D) or not (ND) and
   among Ds, as insulin-dependent (D\_ID) or not (D\_NID). Initial glucose
   concentrations and identified values of rho, ki, eta i in the different
   groups have been compared using proper statistical tests (p<0.01).
   Results: There were were 37 (26,4\%) D patients and 16 of them were
   D\_ID (43,2\%). Initial plasma glucose concentration statistically
   differs both between D and ND and between D\_ID and D\_NID patients.
   Among the patient-specific parameters rho, and K-Na, K-Mg, K-Creatinine
   and K-Bicarbonate results were different between D and ND. The values of
   eta(Na), eta(Mg), eta(Ca), eta(Urea) and eta(Creatinine), instead,
   significantly differ between D\_ID and D\_NID. Discussion:
   Diabetes-induced autonomic and peripheral neuropathies can justify the
   finding of altered capillary wall permeability in D; moreover the use of
   insulin, protein based, seems to impact on the mass transport through
   the dialyzer membrane. The proposed approach allows adding a new tile to
   the studies on how the diabetic pathology affects the response to the HD
   treatment.
   Objectives: Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) therapy has become an
   accepted treatment for end-stage heart-failure. While patient management
   has improved over the past decades, limitations in caregiver resources
   necessitate efficient allocation. Decisions on the optimal setting of
   LVAD support currently occurs in intervals ranging from a few weeks to a
   few months. However, the optimal setting for LVAD support may change
   multiple times per minute. Thus, automation is the only viable solution
   to this problem. Physiological control promises to integrate the cardiac
   assist device into patient physiology even more closely, reacting to
   varying demands or specifying the load for training of the heart muscle.
   One important design consideration is the choice of feedback variable.
   Methods: Literature of the past two decades was collected and the
   presented physiological control concepts were clustered into categories
   corresponding to functional similarity of feedback variables. Results:
   It was found that most literature could be summarized into five
   categories. Control algorithms either used preload, heart rate,
   ventricular contraction, or afterload as feedback variables or modified
   the flowrate/headpressure relation. Discussion: Each of these categories
   contains information about the cardiac state. While preload variables,
   most closely resemble the native functioning of the left ventricle, they
   are inherently difficult to measure without using additional sensors.
   Chronotropic incompetence might be a limiting factor for heart rate
   based control. Ventricular functioning might fluctuate over time due to
   changes in inotropy while afterload is heavily regulated by other
   autoregulatory mechanisms. The headpressure/flowrate relation suffers
   from uncertainty regarding the origin of pressure changes. Combining
   elements of these five categories into one control concept might prove
   beneficial, as different information could be extracted for the
   controller, which could then be tuned by the physician.
   Objectives: Current understanding of membrane performance in
   hemodialysis implies that their permeability in terms of molecular
   weight cut-off must be restricted to a figure below the molecular weight
   of albumin, i.e. < 60.000. Nephrologists commonly request a maximal
   allowable albumin loss during a 4h treatment to be below 4g per session.
   Methods: Recent investigations have shown that the 3D-conformation of
   albumin is unstable and changes in e.g., uremia or liver failure. Thus,
   detoxification efficiency of albumin may decrease by about 70\% and can
   be explained by a considerable reduction of albumin's binding constants
   for both pharmaceutical drugs and uremic retention solutes, as well as
   for exogenous toxins. As a result, free concentrations of such solutes
   increase in patient's blood and a higher toxicity is observed. Binding
   constants for defined uremic retention solutes, such as p-Cresylsulfate,
   are further affected by the simultaneous presence of other solutes, such
   as Indoxylsulfate. Results: Oxidative stress, as manifested in many
   dialysis patients, further promotes changes in albumin conformation.
   It's thus no surprise, that hemodialysis with protein-permeable
   membranes improves patient performance, as shown recently in a clinical
   trial by Nagai et al., (Ther Apher Dial, 2017; 21:378). They reported,
   that in a 7-year observation period, albumin leakage of 3g or more per
   HD session provided a better prognosis than albumin leakage less than
   3g. Obviously, a clinically acceptable large albumin leakage provides
   beneficial effects on maintenance HD patients. Discussion: The
   performance of albumin as an adsorbing protein is inefficient during
   uremia and liver failure. Due to lower binding constants for
   pharma-drugs and uremic toxins following conformational changes in the
   sick state, albumin is unable to perform like in the healthy state. It
   should, thus, be removed. Identification of 3D-changes of albumin and
   thus its removal should become a priority.
   Cataract surgery followed by implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL)
   is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures in medicine.
   In 2020 alone, there are expected to be 32 million interventions. Here,
   ophthalmologists can look back on 70 years of experience. Since there is
   no blood perfusion at the lens, however, the IOL has a comparatively
   simple immunological special position. Furthermore, the ophthalmologists
   also have extensive experience with implants in the cornea, in the
   chamber angle of the eye and on the retina. In the presentation an
   overview will be given of the current implants and the necessary
   regulatory processes. In addition, own experiences (with medical
   devices) with the new requirements of the MDR will be described.
   Recent evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) suggests that
   post-dilutional haemodiafiltration (HDF) is associated with a benefit in
   survival. This benefit has been mainly observed in re-analyses of the
   primary data looking at the patients treated with the highest convection
   volumes (HCV-HDF). To obtain HCV-HDF, significant pressure has to be
   applied to the dialyser membrane and the dialysis systems are submitted
   to significantly stronger transmembrane pressure (TMP) constraints,
   frequently surpassing the limits proposed by the guidelines. Several
   automatized systems are proposed to avoid or overcome the alarms induced
   by the increases in convection and still maintain the volumes prescribed
   by the physician. The present overview will
   i) Critically analyse the evidence on the effect of convection volumes
   on survival. ii) Review the automatic systems presently proposed to
   achieve a given level of convection. iii) Analyse the possible pitfalls
   in determining the limits established by a dialysis monitor when
   performing HCV-HDF. iv) Explore a harmonised definition of the
   parameters that may drive the convection volumes during a dialysis
   procedure with the aim to help in better defining the Best Practice
   Guidelines for HCV-HDF.
   Objectives: Human Parvovirus B19 (HPV B19) infection is known to cause
   pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) in kidney transplant recipients. We
   investigated the diagnosis and prognosis of HPV B19 infection by urine
   detection in kidney transplant patients with anemia and graft
   dysfunction. Methods: 1195 recipients (living donor/donation after
   citizen's death: 492/703) were performed kidney transplant in our center
   from January 2015 to January 2018. Thirty-six patients diagnosed with
   HPV B19 infection during follow-up (3.01\%, 36/1195). Among those,
   fourteen HPV B19 infected patients underwent transplanted kidney biopsy,
   including 12 persons with PRCA and graft dysfunction and 2 recipients
   with donor-derived HPV B19 infection. We collected the urine samples for
   detection of HPV B19 DNA copies at the day of kidney biopsy. Meanwhile,
   the biopsy specimen were studied for immunohistochemical detection by
   using polyclonal mouse Anti-Parvovirus B19 antibody. Results: The mean
   diagnosis time of fourteen HPV B19 infected patients was 44 days
   (7-300days) after transplantation. The reticulocyte percentage was
   0.1-0.2\% and the mean hemoglobin level was 67 g/L (51-87 g/L). Among 12
   biopsies with PRCA and graft dysfunction, 6 were diagnosed with T
   cell-mediated rejection (IA-IB-IIA), 3 borderline rejection, 2 without
   rejection signs and 1 was diagnosed with thrombotic microangiopathy
   (TMA). The patient, who was diagnosed with TMA, had performed
   ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation. It displayed glomerular
   microthrombus and diffuse necrosis of renal tubules on renal biopsy.
   Despite the treatment of IVIG, the graft was ultimately lost. The
   immunohistochemical result of the TMA biopsy specimen was positive and
   the others were negative. The result of urine detection for HPV B19
   virus DNA copies was >10 boolean AND 5/ml with TMA and the others were
   negative. Discussion: If the urine test is positive for HPV B19 DNA,
   parvovirus -associated kidney injury should be suspected.
   Hemodynamic simulations are increasingly used to assess the flow
   phenomena in intracranial aneurysms (IAs). Based on detailed simulation
   results existing therapies such as coiling or stenting can be improved
   or novel approaches are tested. However, the accuracy of
   patient-specific blood flow acquisitions strongly depends on preliminary
   and highly interdisciplinary steps. These include for instance medical
   imaging, image reconstruction, image segmentation and acquisition of
   appropriate boundary conditions. To assess capabilities, but also
   limitations of state-of-art IA modeling techniques, international
   simulation challenges are frequently organized. These comparisons
   address single or combined steps along the simulation process. Within
   this talk, the most relevant competitions are presented and the main
   findings are summarized. In this regard, sources of error in the context
   of hemodynamic modeling are revealed and the awareness for standardized
   simulations is sharpened.
   Objectives: Heart failure (HF) is a critical healthcare issue and a
   primary source of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Globally, it is
   estimated that up to 100,000 people are candidates for heart
   transplantation, but only about 5800 transplants were performed in 2016.
   At Cleveland Clinic, we are developing a continuous-flow total
   artificial heart (CFTAH) in an attempt to provide a viable alternative
   to transplantation for the growing population of patients with end-stage
   HF. Methods: The Cleveland Clinic CFTAH is a double-ended centrifugal
   pump with only one moving part that is designed to passively
   self-balance left and right circulations without active intervention.
   The device has no mechanical bearings to wear out and is driven by an
   extremely reliable 3-phase brushless, sensorless motor. The nominal
   external dimensions of the latest version of our adult CFTAH design to
   be tested in-vivo were 98.4 mm in length, 62 mm in diameter, 160 cc in
   volume displacement and 486 g in weight without the cable. Results:
   Biocompatibility of the CFTAH has been demonstrated in two full-term
   90-day in vivo tests, completed without the use of any anticoagulation.
   Since the conclusion of these tests, our team has been working on design
   improvements to further reduce susceptibility to thrombosis, enhance
   autoregulation, improve motor controller hardware, add clinically useful
   features to the control interface and enhance manufacturability.
   Discussion: Our results to date suggest that a small, mechanically and
   electronically simple, auto-regulated total artificial heart has
   significant potential to provide an important clinical option for HF
   patients.
   We discuss a novel method for hemolysis prediction in computational
   fluid dynamics, which avoids potential problems inherent to the
   traditionally used Eulerian and Lagrangian methods. The traditionally
   used Eulerian method computes a hemolysis index (HI) at the flow outlet
   by solving a transport partial differential equation (PDE) where the
   source term equals shear stress raised to some power (which is
   determined empirically), and then looks at the HI transported to the
   flow outlet. The largest contribution to HI typically occurs at the flow
   boundaries (walls), which is precisely the location where numerical
   noise is most likely to be inadvertently introduced, e.g., from sharp
   edges in the wall or from low quality mesh elements. This can cause
   errors in the Eulerian method because its PDE lacks a diffusion term,
   and consequently any numerical noise is transported to, and accumulates
   at, the flow outlet surface. We have not seen this potential problem
   occurring when using a Lagrangian method, although theoretically it
   could still occur. Regardless, a major disadvantage of the Lagrangian
   method is a large computational cost required to achieve reasonable
   accuracy. Instead of using one of the two traditional methods, we use a
   volume integral where the source term includes both shear stress and
   flow speed. In situations with sufficient mixing, such as in an LVAD,
   this approach predicts blood damage at least as well as either of the
   other methods, for a fraction of the computational cost, and avoids the
   numerical problems. The method also lends itself better to frozen rotor
   simulations, while the traditional methods prefer more costly
   time-dependent simulations. We present an example where the method is
   used to evaluate potential changes to a HM3-like rotor design.
   Objectives: A great and long pursued goal in cancer research is the
   development of a suitable culture system for expanding haematopoietic
   stem cells (HSCs), which can thereafter be successfully used in
   transplantations. Since HSCs only reproduce in their natural
   environment, novel systems try to mimic the in vivo niche of HSCs, the
   bone marrow, in many factors such as material rigidity, chemical and
   cellular compositions. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are known
   to support HSC expansion. This effect is even greater when the cells are
   cocultured in a 3D environment. The aim of this project is to study the
   interactions of HSCs and MSCs in a conventional 2D culture compared with
   a 3D porous hydrogel, which was previously developed in our group.
   Methods: The influence of HSCs on MSCs and vice versa will be studied on
   a transcriptomic level by next generation sequencing and verified by
   qPCR, cytokine arrays and western blots. To regain the cells from the
   system we want to make our hydrogel degradable by introducing disulfide
   bonds, which can be cleaved by reducing agents. Afterwards the RNA will
   be fixed within the cells and these will be separated by magnetic cell
   sorting, previous to RNA isolation. Results: Previous experiments
   indicate that the 3D system has a positive effect on HSCs only in
   coculture with MSCs. With a deep insight into the transcriptomes of both
   cell types in coculture, we hope to identify key molecules playing a
   role in this phenomenon and in HSC expansion. Such key molecules shall
   further be tested for their influence on the coculture by inhibition or
   enhancement. Discussion: The HSC expansion in vitro while maintaining
   their stem cell character has been a major and challenging goal in
   research for more than 60 years. By finding and influencing key
   molecules of the HSC-MSC interaction, we hope to further develop our 3D
   hydrogel system and increase HSC expansion in vitro.
   Objectives: Small molecule drugs can be bound to plasma proteins.
   Examples are Apixaban (459 Da, 87\% protein bound), Carvedilol (406 Da,
   98\% protein bound) or Calcitriol (416 Da, 99.9 \% protein bound). In
   plasma, these drugs have a free and a protein bound fraction. Protein
   binding impacts the removal behavior of the drug during dialysis. The
   purpose of this work was to develop a quantitative model to describe the
   removal of these solutes, and validate the model experimentally.
   Methods: A mathematical model was developed by coupling the equations of
   transport in dialyzers reported in one of our previous studies, and mass
   balance equations reported in literature to include the effect of
   binding. Simulated HD treatments with human plasma were performed with 3
   different types of commercial dialyzers having different membrane
   permeability to study the removal of Apixaban, Carvedilol or Calcitriol,
   expressed in terms of solute clearance. Additionally, the loss of
   albumin was quantified. Results: Experimental clearance results
   {[}ml/min] are given as mean +/- MAD from 3 independent experiments in
   the order of Apixaban / Carvedilol / Calcitriol. Calculated values are
   reported in brackets. Dialyzer 1 was tested in HDF mode, yielding
   clearance of 60 +/- 1.0 {[}61] / 41 +/- 1.8 {[}10]/ < 6 {[}0.5].
   Dialyzer 2 tested in HD mode yielded clearance of 60 +/- 1.6{[} 60] / 31
   +/- 1.6 {[}10] / Discussion: Clearance of tested drugs was lower than
   expected for their nominal molecular weight. The levels scaled Apixaban
   > Carvedilol >> Calcitriol, which is inverse to their degree of protein
   binding (Apixaban < Carvedilol << Calcitriol). The degree of protein
   binding was revealed to be the actual critical determinant, rather than
   dialyzer design and operational mode. Drug clearance seemed to be driven
   by the proportion of the free fractions, as is reflected in the model by
   the increase of clearance for decreasing bound fraction.
   Objectives: In the development of biocompatible materials for biomedical
   applications, the foreign body response is an important issue. The
   healing of surrounding tissue often interferes with the function of an
   implanted biomaterial. Events like protein deposition, hemostasis,
   inflammation, tissue repair, infections and the encapsulation of the
   functional part of the implant are the main cause of failure of the
   implanted device. Methods: In this study biocompatible nanofilms are
   produced by means of a plasma polymerization process using a
   low-pressure magnetron-enhanced 15 kHz glow discharge. This process
   allows the precise control of the film nature and behaviour. The
   resulting hydrocarbon film has a thickness of a few nanometer and keeps
   therefore the inherent properties of the substrate material.
   Measurements on protein adsorption gave the possibility to tailor the
   thin films in the needed direction. This means to tailor a native
   secondary structure of in situ adsorbed proteins. Results: The nanofilms
   were investigated using different surface analytical methods. Also the
   interaction in contact with different biological sample materials was
   tested in-vitro. The precise measurement of the adsorbed proteins
   indicated a native secondary structure of proteins on these surfaces.
   Different in-vivo sensor dummies which are in contact with blood and
   soft-tissue were coated by these nanofilms. The explanted sensors were
   kept free of any encapsulation by this coating. This stands in good
   correlation with the measurement of adsorbed proteins. Discussion: The
   first in-vitro results of the adsorption of blood proteins indicated
   already a very biocompatible character of these nanofilms. The explanted
   sensors were kept free of any encapsulation by this coating. These
   coatings can open the door for many new applications in the field of new
   implants but also other biomedical products.
   Objectives: Human placenta tissue has great advantages to be used as
   tissue source due to its molecular composition and its availability as
   clinical waste product. In our previous studies, human placenta arteries
   were decellularized and showed low immunogenicity and a supportive
   environment for cell migration and proliferation. Decellularized
   extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogels are a widely-used tool in the field
   of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. To create placental ECM
   hydrogel (pECM-HG) decellularized arterial grafts were further processed
   by an enzymatic pepsin digestion. Methods: pECM-HG were biochemically
   analyzed. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize fiber
   structures. Cell adherence and migration assays were carried out on
   pECM-HG coated culture plates to confirm cytocompatibility of the
   material. As next step pECM-HG was used for coating of vascular grafts
   in a reseeding experiment using a perfused 3D bioreactor system.
   Furthermore, biomechanical properties of 3D hydrogels were tested by
   rheological measurements. Results: pECM-HG showed low amount of DNA
   residuals and preservation of cell interacting ECM proteins. SEM
   analysis revealed the formation of specific fibrous structures,
   dependent on respective hydrogel concentration. Cell binding and
   viability assays showed significantly enhanced cell adherence and
   increased proliferation rates when seeded on surfaces coated with
   pECM-HG (p<0.001) compared to controls. pECM-HG showed beneficial
   properties for cell reseeding on acellular vascular grafts in a flow
   bioreactor system. Discussion: We developed a hydrogel from human
   vascular tissue that is cytocompatible and supports cell adherence and
   proliferation. We hypothesize that this hydrogel has great potential due
   to its origin and composition. Further investigations on the hydrogel
   composition are ongoing. It is planned use the pECM-HG for 3D cell
   printing applications or as injectable hydrogel to support ischemic
   injury regeneration.
   Objectives: Intra-aortic Balloon Pump (IABP) is undoubtedly the most
   widely used mechanical circulatory support system for a range of severe
   heart failure indications. Average duration of IABP use is 1-3 days,
   however its longer-term use has not been adequately studied. The
   objective of this work is to establish the extent to which the IABP
   duration has been used, and also to examine the clinical outcome
   pertaining to prolonged use of IABP, using meta-analysis of literature
   data. Methods: We defined IABP prolonged use as 7 days or longer; a
   choice based on a duration that is greater than double the current
   perceived average use. We systematically reviewed the literature
   (Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science) and identified 14 studies that have
   prolonged IABP use between 1968 - 2018. Patients indications included
   heart failure (refractory, congestive, end stage), ventricular
   arrhythmia, myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock. Results: A
   total number of 1707 patients of both genders received prolonged IABP
   use with an overall average of 22.6 days. The studied cohort is split
   into: Group 1: n= 1683 adults, mean age 57.9 years, range 19-84 years
   old, average use of 21.2 days. Survival rate in this group was 64.4\%.
   Group 2: n=24 infants and children, mean age 5.5 years, range 7
   days-17.5 years old, average use 24 days. Overall mean survival rate to
   discharge was 62.5\%. At a mean follow-up of 85 months, all 15 survivors
   were alive and well. Discussion: Due to its ease of insertion and
   relative low cost, IABP presents the first port of call in a wide range
   of heart failure scenarios. This analysis indicates that, age does not
   seem to be a significant parameter that affect outcomes of IABP
   long-term use. Although, IABP is perceived to be only a short-term
   support, its prolonged use is evident with successful outcomes. Further
   trials of IABP long-term use for children and adults is warranted to
   further establish the range of indications IABP can be utilised as a
   long-term support.
   Objectives: Human serum albumin (HSA), one of the dominating proteins in
   human plasma with its exceptional binding capacity plays an important
   role in storing and transporting different substances throughout the
   human circulatory system. Clinically used to treat a variety of
   diseases, particularly in liver failure therapy, pharmaceutical-grade
   HSA contains high amounts of stabilizers, such as Na-caprylate and
   N-acetyltryptophanate. These compounds represent potential risks to
   patients with restricted liver function. The aim of this study was to
   test if the elimination of stabilizers by adsorbent technique affects
   HSA's secondary structure. Methods: Albumin infusion solutions (BIOMED,
   Germany) were filtered using a commercial system Hepalbin (Albutec,
   Germany). Raman- and FTIR spectroscopy as well as DSC analysis were
   applied to analyze conformational changes in treated and untreated HSA
   samples. For Raman based studies different parameters such as object
   slides type, integration time, accumulations number and laser capacity
   were investigated. Results: Preliminarily results of the
   physical-chemical analyses showed some differences for filtered samples
   in comparison to the unfiltered ones. Raman and FTIR spectra exhibited
   both, peak shifts in characteristic HSA amide bands and an alteration in
   the peaks' shape. DSC thermograms revealed significant differences in
   denaturation temperatures of the compared samples. Discussion: A Raman
   shift in amide I band and changes in the alpha-helix/beta-sheet ratio
   detected via FTIR spectroscopy indicated a possible alteration in the
   HSA conformation after filtration. These findings were corroborated by
   DCS showing a tendency towards lower denaturation temperatures in
   samples after stabilizers removal. The results may contribute to finding
   a compromise between stability and high functional performance of HSA
   for the improvement of liver failure therapy.
   Objectives: The protein fibrinogen is important in blood coagulation and
   wound healing. Hence, nanofibrous fibrinogen scaffolds are highly
   attractive as biomaterials. One currently used technique to prepare
   fibrinogen nanofibers in vitro is electrospinning. Since this technique
   uses organic solvents and high electric fields, which can impede the
   biological protein function, we have developed a novel technique to
   prepare fibrinogen scaffolds with physiological buffers. Methods: We
   introduced the novel method of salt-induced self assembly under
   controlled drying conditions to prepare nanofibrous fibrinogen
   scaffolds. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was used to
   characterize the fiber morphology. We studied the secondary structure
   with Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. To assess the
   biocompatibility of our novel scaffolds we analyzed the proliferation of
   3T3 mouse fibroblasts with WST1 assays and studied the cell morphology
   with SEM. Results: Salt-induced self assembly reproducibly yielded
   fibrinogen nanofibers with overall scaffold dimensions in the centimeter
   range. SEM analysis revealed fiber diameters between 200 and 300 nm. By
   adding a customized fixation step after the fiber formation we
   fabricated either immobilized or free-standing fibrinogen networks
   depending on the underlying substrate material. With FTIR spectroscopy
   we found a higher content of beta-sheet structures for fibrinogen
   nanofibers in comparison to planar fibrinogen. 3T3 fibroblasts were
   found to proliferate well on fibrinogen nanofibers with cell numbers
   comparable to planar fibrinogen substrates. SEM analysis showed that 3T3
   fibroblasts grew in close contact with fibrinogen nanofibers.
   Discussion: Our new self assembly process offers a well controllable and
   physiological biofabrication method for large-scale fibrinogen
   scaffolds. Based on the good biocompatibility results our fibrinogen
   networks are very promising candidates for a new class of wound
   dressings.
   Total artificial hearts (TAH) are used to restore quality of life to
   biventricular heart failure patients but can also introduce significant
   risks. Several features were included in to the BiVACOR design to
   mitigate some of the major risks, such as 1) device malfunction, 2)
   insufficient hemocompatibility, 3) ineffective physiological
   interaction, and 4) inappropriate device geometry. To achieve a durable
   design the BiVACOR TAH reduces mechanical wear by levitating a single
   rotating impeller in a magnetic field. To reduce the incidence of single
   fault failures, the levitation and drive systems incorporate backup
   features. Large clearance gaps in the blood flow path and cyclic speed
   variations assist hemocompatibility. Physiological interaction is
   improved via autonomous left/right outflow balancing, the ability to
   inherently adapt total outflow based on physiological conditions, and to
   respond to variations in filling volumes. Initial durability testing is
   ongoing with no device failures after 180 days. The redundant motor and
   hydrodynamic backup bearing maintain hemodynamic function when failure
   modes are induced. Preliminary NIH, platelet activation and vWF
   degradation during in-vitro tests show lower levels than implantable
   VADs. In-vivo results (1x90day, 3x30-day) confirm benchtop observations.
   When operated with either pulsatile or non-pulsatile outflow up to 15
   l/min, or with the hydrodynamic backup bearing, pfHb ranged between
   0.5-2mg/dL. The system can balance outflows under a wide variety of
   physiological conditions, while inherently adjusting flows by more than
   4 l/min. Finally, device weight and size allowed a good anatomical fit
   in human cadavers with BSA >1.4m(2). By implementing the risk mitigating
   design features, the BiVACOR device aims to provide patients with a
   durable, hemocompatible, and physiological interactive TAH with suitable
   anatomical fit. Successful development of this device may ultimately
   lead to a long-term alternative to heart transplants.
   Objectives: Visualization of hemodynamics often represents a
   simplification of blood as a monophasic fluid. In this study, blood is
   used as a multiphase fluid. The aim is to fabricate artificial blood to
   visualize hemodynamics with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). More
   specific, micro beads (ArtErys), which mimic the erythrocytes, are
   fabricated with a membrane-emulsion-technology system (MET). This system
   is developed and compared with the results (e.g. ArtEry size) of three
   other methods: microfluidic, electro-spraying and air flow. Methods: The
   ArtErys are made of hydrogels (Agarose 0.3-0.7 wt.\%) to match
   refractive index and biomechanics. For PIV tracking, particles
   (Sphericals (c), 20 mu m) are encapsulated directly into the ArtErys and
   are not added to the plasma where they might affect the hemodynamics.
   For the MET system, different oils (e.g. paraffin) are used as disperse
   phase. The Agarose/PIV mixture is pumped (50 to 100 ml/h) into a
   constant oil flow (5 to 40 ml/h) through a PTFE membrane (Reichelt
   Chemietchnik GmbH, pore size 60 mu m). The ArtErys are created during
   this process and transported away by the oil. The MET process is carried
   out in a heated water bath with a temperature of 55 degrees C. Results:
   The ArtEry size depends mainly on two parameters: the flow rate of the
   agarose/PIV solution and the flow rate of the oil. A flow rate of 80
   ml/h Agarose/PIV solution leads to smallest bead sizes with a mean
   diameter of 150 mu m. High rates lead to merging of the ArtErys, which
   is reflected in a larger diameter. Furthermore, the bead size depends on
   the parameter oil flow rate. Here, a rate of 30 ml/h leads to the
   smallest beads. Discussion: The MET method has been successfully
   implemented to fabricate ArtErys with encapsulated PIV particles.
   Compared to the other methods, the MET system fabricates the biggest
   ArtEry sizes (MET: 150 mu m, microfluidic: 15 mu m, electro-spraying: 80
   mu m, air flow: 100 mu m).
   Objectives: Since the latest revision of the Medical Devices (MDs)
   Directive, the European regulatory framework considers stand-alone
   software as a MD per se, as confirmed by the MD Regulation. The recent
   surge of AI tools, which promise to be ubiquitous soon, poses problems
   relative to their certification as MDs. In view of the already granted
   market approval in Europe and the USA for some AI-based MDs, we aimed to
   investigate the main relevant issues of such MDs' regulation. Methods:
   Unlike traditional SW as MDs, for which established standards already
   exist (e.g., IEC 62304, ``Software life-cycle processes{''}), for AI
   tools there are very few specific standards. The definition of AI, or
   intelligence itself, is by no means universally accepted. Thus, we
   limited the scope of AI to Machine/Deep Learning (ML/DL). Results: 1)
   ML/DL tools are data intensive, so that a critical issue is how to
   construct a representative set of input data. E.g., IEC 62304 recommends
   that the manufacturer include software system inputs and outputs, in the
   SW requirements: this is clearly too generic for a DL tool. 2)
   Guidelines for acceptable input data size should be drawn, for a given
   system/software architecture. Moreover, quality check of training data
   should always be executed, before SW training. Quality of ML/DL tools
   and of physical architecture is also relevant. 3) Generally, DL tools
   lack an explicit declarative knowledge representation, hence it is
   difficult or impossible to assess to ``reasoning{''} behind the
   algorithmic decisions. ``Explainable{''} AI should be the standard, in
   order to rule out fuzziness in machine clinical decision making and
   impossibility to pinpoint the problem(s), in view of the legal
   responsibility for MD use. It has been found that DL performance
   conflicts with explainability, thus priority setting will be crucial.
   Discussion: The regulatory treatment of AI-based MDs needs improvements,
   in order to have safe and effective products, as well as wider societal
   acceptance.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is to design a reliable and efficient
   sheath for an implantable part of a device for the wireless inductive
   powering of artificial organs. Methods: Wireless inductive power
   transfer can help get rid of the problems of recharge and wired constant
   power supply to artificial organs. However, the design of the
   implantable part of the transcutaneous powering device, or so-called
   assembly, is complicated by the lack of a comprehensive solution of
   technical and medical problems. The assembly must be encapsulated in the
   sheath which requires the choice of a biocompatible and non-magnetic
   material. This eliminates the formation of eddy currents on the sheath,
   whereby negative influence on the energy transfer is minimized. At the
   same time, the material should have a low thermal conductivity (about
   0.5 W / (m . K)) to prevent overheating of the tissue from the
   circuitry. The sheath of the assembly must have sufficient durability to
   protect the circuitry. The form-factor of the sheath should be minimized
   for the convenience of the patient (dimensions in the limit of 20 x 20 x
   3 mm). Results: The sheath was developed for the assembly prototype. The
   assembly provides an output power in the range 0.45 horizontal ellipsis
   0.55 W for the axial distance between the coils in the range 10
   horizontal ellipsis 20 mm and the lateral misalignment up to 20 mm. The
   calculation and measurement were performed in the air and with the
   samples of ``skin-fat{''} biological objects, in order to determine and
   verify the sheath characteristics. Discussion: We have developed and
   tested the assembly's sheath for inductive powering of artificial organs
   that meets technical and medical requirements.
   Objectives: Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are used in medicine for
   targeted drug delivery to the area of cancer. There is the problem of
   remotely determining in vivo concentrations of MNPs. The aim of our work
   was to experimentally test acoustomagnetic method (AMM) for detecting
   MNPs in a model sample of a biological substance (BS). Methods: A
   colloidal solution of Fe3O4 nanoparticles in a mixture of oleic acid and
   kerosene was used as a model sample. The weight concentration of the
   MNPs in the solution was 0.15\%, and the viscosity of the solution was
   close to the blood viscosity. To detect MNPs in solution, a special
   experimental setup was developed. The installation consists of an
   ultrasound generator, a permanent magnet, a glass container with a
   solution, an induction multi-turn coil near the glass tube, and a
   voltmeter as a measure of the voltage across the coil. Ultrasound causes
   periodic movement of the particles of the solution together with the
   MNPs along the container axis. The magnet orients the MNPs in the
   direction perpendicular to the axis of the container. As a result, the
   summation of MNPs creates an alternating magnetic field with an
   ultrasonic frequency in the coil area. An alternating voltage (U) arises
   on the coil, as measured by a voltmeter. Results: As measurements have
   shown, the magnitude of the voltage is proportional to the concentration
   of MNPs in the field of action of the ultrasound and the magnet field,
   as well as the intensity of the ultrasound. In particular, when the
   intensity of ultrasound was at the level of 0.02 W/ cm2, U = 1mV was
   obtained. Discussion: The experimental results are consistent with the
   calculated estimates and suggest that AMM can be used to detect MNPs in
   a real BS. Considering that the magnitude of the constant magnetic field
   in these experiments was 0.1T, we can also conclude that this method is
   safe, more accurate, and easier to implement than traditional X-ray and
   MRT methods.
   Objectives: For a single hemodialysis session several hundred liters of
   water are consumed. Water scarcity and inadequate water purification
   facilities worsen contamination risk especially in developing countries.
   Here, we investigate the application of a mixed matrix membrane (MMM),
   which combines filtration and adsorption, for achieving endotoxin-free
   dialysate combined to high removal of uremic toxins from human plasma.
   Methods: We investigate the adsorption of lipo-polysacharide (LPS) by a
   MMM in both static and dynamic conditions. Dynamic adsorption of LPS is
   also investigated in presence of uremic toxins in human plasma.
   Diffusion experiments using dialysate contaminated with bacterial
   culture filtrates are also performed to assess the ability of the MMM to
   act as a safety-barrier to avoid transfer of pyrogens to the plasma. A
   membrane without sorbents is used as control and the obtained results
   are compared with literature studies using current dialysis membranes.
   Results: The MMM can remove approximately 10 times more endotoxins from
   dialysate compared to commercial dialysis membranes. No transfer of
   pyrogens was detected in the blood compartment, revealing safety-barrier
   properties of the MMM. Importantly, endotoxins from dialysate and
   protein-bound toxins from human plasma can be removed simultaneously
   without compromising AC adsorption capacity. Discussion: We estimate
   that 0.15 m(2)of MMM is needed to remove the daily production of the
   protein-bound toxins, indoxyl sulfate and hippuric acid and to
   completely remove endotoxins in a wearable artificial kidney (WAK)
   device. Future studies would focus on the applicability of the MMM in
   wearable/portable artificial kidneys and in general for
   home-hemodialysis treatments.
   Objectives: Nearly half of all heart failure patients suffer from heart
   failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). With no effective
   treatment, a major clinical need is presented. The aim of this study was
   the hemo - and fluid dynamic investigation of a valveless pulsatile pump
   for HFpEF using in-vitro, ex-vivo, computational fluid dynamic (CFD),
   and 4D flow MRI imaging studies. Methods: The pump is a pneumatically
   driven pulsatile pump with a single valveless cannula that is to be
   implanted through the LV apex and is operated synchronously with the
   left ventricle. A prototype of the proposed pump system was fabricated.
   The pump was tested in an in-vitro hybrid mock loop system to evaluate
   its hemodynamic effect in four HFpEF phenotypes. Further hemodynamic
   evaluation was conducted by implanting the pump in an ex-vivo isolated
   heart model. CFD was employed for flow field analysis of two different
   pump designs-a symmetric and an asymmetric configuration. The results
   were validated by 4D flow MRI imaging of the respective prototypes.
   Results: In the in-vitro studies, the pump augmented cardiac output (CO)
   by 14 - 30\% and reduced left atrial pressure (LAP) by 14 - 30\%.
   Ex-vivo studies showed the similar hemodynamic trends: augmented CO by
   20.0 +/- 9.7\%, and reduced LAP by 57.5 +/- 14.4\%. Fluid dynamic
   simulations revealed good correlation with the respective 4D flow
   measurements. The asymmetric configuration disclosed superior fluid
   dynamic performance with 94.5\% of the initial blood being exchanged
   after 3 beats. Discussion: It was demonstrated that the valveless
   pulsatile device can improve hemodynamics in HFpEF patients by
   augmenting CO and reducing LAP. Appropriate washout of the pump chamber
   is achieved by a persisting vortex evolving within the asymmetric design
   throughout each pump cycle. By demonstrating the hemodynamic effects and
   promising fluid dynamic performance of the pump, feasibility of the
   system as a potential treatment option for HFpEF patients is supported.
   Objectives: In this work, the denaturation behaviour of bovine serum
   albumin (BSA) in single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) aqueous
   nanodispersions during heating was analyzed using differential scanning
   calorimetry. Thermodynamic effects of BSA interaction with SWCNTs have
   been discussed. The calculation procedure for estimating the parameters
   of laser treatment on the basis of differential scanning calorimetry
   data is presented. Accurate calculation of the optimal parameters of
   laser treatment, under which there is complete denaturation of albumin
   and the solid nanocomposite material is forming, will minimize the
   thermal damage of the connected tissues, while not reducing the tensile
   strength of the seam. Methods: Laser solders based on water dispersion
   of BSA (25 \% w/w) and SWCNTs (0, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 \% w/w) were used
   for differential scanning calorimetry study. Studies were conducted in
   hermetically sealed crucibles with heating rates of 3, 5, 10 and 20
   degrees C/min. Results: The specific energies and denaturation
   temperatures of the laser solders were measured. The use of SWCNTs led
   to a decrease in the specific energy of denaturation from 4.11 to 3.27
   J/g and a denaturation temperature from 87.2 to 86.9 degrees C. The
   activation energy of albumin denaturation in laser solder has doubled
   during use SWCNTs Discussion: Thermodynamic effects of BSA interaction
   with SWCNTs have been discussed, namely the changes in temperature
   characteristics of denaturation processes and the partial thermal
   destabilization of albumin. The energetic parameters of laser treatment
   have been estimated on the basis of differential scanning calorimetry
   data. The values obtained are optimal for complete BSA denaturation
   resulting in formation of solid nanocomposite material with minimal
   thermal damage of the connected tissues and sufficient tensile strength
   of the seam.
   Objectives: Clot formation in the membrane oxygenator is a serious
   complication in long-term extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In
   the blood vessels, nitric oxide (NO) generated by nitric oxide synthase
   on the endothelial cells suppresses both aggregation/activation of
   platelets and adhesion/activation of leukocytes. Therefore,
   biocompatibility of the membrane oxygenator may be improved by the
   addition of NO gas to the sweep gas. The objective of the present study
   was to determine, using a rat ECMO model, whether addition of NO gas to
   the blood can suppress blood coagulation. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley
   rats weighing 350 to 400 g were used for the experiments. After the rats
   were anesthetized, extracorporeal circulation was established by guiding
   the blood from the right jugular vein into the left femoral vein.
   Heparin was administered by bolus injection (0.7 unit/g-rat) only at the
   start of the ECMO. Polymethyl pentene membranes were used for the
   oxygenator. The sweep gas (NO: 0, 100 or 200 ppm, O2: 30\%, CO2: 5\%,
   N2: balance) was added to the blood via the oxygenator. During the
   experiment, the arterial pressure, oxygenator inlet pressure, venous
   pressure, activated whole blood clotting time (ACT), and methemoglobin
   (Met-Hb) concentration were measured. After circulation, the hemoglobin
   (Hb) content and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the eluate from
   the residual blood in the oxygenator were measured. Results:
   Extracorporeal circulation was stably performed for 4 hours. There were
   no differences in the ACT during the experiment among the three groups.
   The amount of Met-Hb was below 10\% in the NO group. The Hb content and
   LDH activity in the eluate were significantly lower in the 200-ppm NO
   group than those in the 0 ppm NO. Discussion: The amount of Met-Hb in
   the NO group indicates that there is no adverse effect related to
   Met-Hb. The Hb content and LDH activity indicate that the NO contained
   in the sweep gas inhibited blood coagulation in this rat extracorporeal
   circulation model.
   Objectives: Data from the WAA apheresis registry was investigated
   regarding patients treated with extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) as a
   tool to modulate immune response in various diseases. Methods: 381
   patients (34\% women) had been treated with ECP for a total of 10668
   procedures. The mean age was 48 years (+/- 18, range 3-81 years).
   Estimation of quality of life was made using grade 0 (suicidal) up to 10
   (best ever) and health quality grade 1 (Bed ridden, ICU condition) up to
   10 (athletic). Adverse events were analyzed. ANOVA comparisons were
   used. Results: Most patients were treated due to graft versus host
   disease (GVHD, n=284) and other hematological diseases (n=34). Adverse
   events were registered in 5.8\% of the first treatments and in 2.1\% of
   the subsequent procedures. Severe adverse events were present in 0.4\%
   of all procedures. No patient died due to the procedure. Tingling and
   stitching were the most common side effects. For those with GVHD the QoL
   was initially at a mean 6.3 (+/- 1.5, range 2-10) and improved
   significantly within 10 procedures and the Health Condition estimate
   improved significantly within 9 procedures and improved further with
   added procedures. Discussion: Photopheresis is an established therapy
   with few side effects. The present data indicate that approximately 10
   procedures are necessary to note significant effect to GVHD.
   Objectives: The most fundamental goal in improving quality of care in
   hospitals is to eliminate unnecessary deaths. AIM: Three-year mortality
   and quality of care between 2015-2017 were evaluated in a tertiary
   nephrology clinic. Methods: Audit of 392 deaths was carried out to
   reveal prevalence of suboptimal clinical observations. Admission
   pressure, direct admissions avoiding public healthcare system, severity
   of clinical conditions, elderly persons dying in the hospital, time of
   admissions and death were evaluated. Results: In 2015 and 2016, 5.5 of
   every 100 inpatients died in the hospital, and this proportion decreased
   to 4.9 in 2017, with high percentage of patients who died in the first
   24 or 48 hours from admission. The percentage of hospital deaths
   occurring in combination with AKI rose from 17\% up to 37\% over the
   three-year study period. Many patients who died with worsening CKD, were
   not ever referred to a nephrologist. More than half of patients were
   admitted on duty and died over weekends. About 5\% of the hospital
   deaths were among patients aged 85 and over, and in 2017 that number
   rose up to 10\%. Patients who died were seriously ill, at least 17\% had
   malignancy. Most of the cardiovascular deaths were directly caused by
   ischemic stroke. Discussion: In this study we did not find patients with
   preventable deaths. The results indicated that patients were seriously
   ill, elderly, some being admitted to hospital to die. Some of the
   patients were kept long period prior to death because of shortage on
   certain facilities. There is admission pressure and other external
   factors contributing to high burden in treatment of the dying patients.
   Still, further effors are necessary for further providing and auditing
   health quality of care.
   Objectives: Human immune cells have been produced using Advanced Therapy
   Medicinal Products (ATMP) guidelines and have been tested in clinical
   studies for a number of diseases, for which still no or only inadequate
   alternative therapies are available. Examples include several cancer
   entities, stroke, myocardial infarction, severe autoimmune disorders and
   chronic infections. Despite many in vitro or in animal studies report
   positive outcomes after immune cell therapy, convincing results showing
   the benefits of ATMP in clinical studies are rare. Part of this
   discrepancy in the outcome of the clinical studies in comparison to the
   in vitro and in animal studies may be caused by the manufacturing of
   immune cells for clinical trials. Cells prepared for clinical trials
   were mostly manufactured using archaic, scarcely controlled and
   incomparable production processes and stringent analytical methods for
   assessing proliferation and differentiation of the immune cells during
   the manufacturing process were not applied. Methods: The production of
   ATMPs is first of all dependent on the donor specific biology, which
   significantly varies from one donor or patient, respectively, to another
   (biological heterogeneity). In case of immune cell therapy, the
   manufacturing process is key for cytotoxic function and is the basis for
   the biological activity of the cells after injection into the patient.
   Results: The challenge for future clinical trials therefore is to
   reproducibly provide a sufficient number of biologically active cells of
   appropriate quality preferably in accordance with quality manufacturing
   guidelines (e. g. Good Manufacturing Practice, ICH etc.). Only using
   cells which have been produced under these rigorous quality control
   regimes will allow the conduction of clinically meaningful trials.
   Discussion: The talk presents a survey and discusses consequences on
   future requirements for manufacturing processes of products for immune
   cell therapies.
   Objectives: Cryopreservation plays a major role in the storage of
   tissues that are kept for subsequent transplantation. A wide variety of
   tissues intended for transplantation for a patient are stored in this
   way. In addition to the assignment to a suitable recipient, it must be
   ensured in particular that a sufficiently long period of time is
   available for infection diagnostic analyses. Cryopreservation of tissue
   is therefore routine in everyday tissue medicine. Methods: As is well
   known, the success of low temperature storage depends in particular on
   coordinated freezing and storage processes, in the optimization of which
   many research approaches have already been investigated. In contrast to
   these well-known principles of important parameter adjustment in this
   context, little attention is paid to optimizing the freezing process in
   the daily routine of tissue medicine. In fact, for some applications the
   suboptimal storage of tissue is not critical, as no vital cells are
   necessary or desired. Results: This reduces the process to a minimum and
   eliminates the need for additives such as cryoprotective agent (CPA) or
   animal/human serum. This is particularly important for tissue
   preparations which, as in Germany, require a medicinal product approval
   by a competent authority. Any change to the process must be first
   approved by the competent authority, the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (PEI).
   Optimizing the freezing process would therefore entail a new approval
   procedure. If the changed process was not previously known in the EU, a
   clinical study is also required. Discussion: For this reason, the
   conditions are not improved in case of doubt, although it is known that
   this could lead to a higher quality of the tissue after thawing. Less
   toxic CPA could simplify the approval procedure and thus contribute to
   improved tissue storage for transplantation. The same applies to the
   cryopreservation of tissue engineered products.
   Vascular access is a key issue for survival for uremic patients that
   need acute or chronic dialysis. In acute settings the use of central
   venous catheters, holding two luminae, are most commonly used in the
   intensive care for continuous or intermittent hemodialysis. Such
   catheters may be of acute type or a chronic type containing a separate
   cuff to limit bacterial invasion into the vessels. Another option is to
   place a peritoneal dialysis catheter into the abdominal cavity. If using
   the right technique, this catheter can be surgically inserted in local
   anesthesia and could be used directly postoperatively for acute but also
   chronic peritoneal dialysis. For chronic hemodialysis (HD) the
   preferable option is to place an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) at the
   lower arm. This results in enlargement of the vein, and partly fibrosis,
   that allows for frequent punctures leaving no material externalized
   after the end of a HD procedure. A problem is the development of
   vascular stenosis and thrombosis that need interventions in at least
   50\% of patients within one year. When the AVF fails an option is to
   insert a graft (AVG). This may be either a biologic or synthetic graft
   interpositioned between the feeding artery and a more proximal vein
   below the elbow instead of the local vein that usually is occluded. If
   this option even fails, the patient has to rely on a sufficient
   permanent central dialysis catheter where complication such as bacterial
   contamination and occlusions are problems. To avoid such catheters a
   dream for future would be a graft as AV access that is made of an
   autologous biodegradable material that has physiological characteristics
   that prevent stenosis and clotting and also is possible to easy correct
   in its diameter to adjust for the volume of blood returned/minute to the
   heart to avoid congestive heart failure.
   Objectives: It has been observed that the in-vivo dialyser clearance for
   small solutes is not constant during a hemodialysis (HD) session. This
   may influence the choice of the value to be measured and reported. We
   investigated the presence of trends in the clearances of urea and
   creatinine, and how it impacts their values. Methods: Diffusive
   clearances were calculated for urea and creatinine from dialysate
   concentration data measured in 25 patients who underwent 3 consecutive
   HD sessions each. Clearance values were obtained for each hour (at 0,
   60, 120, 180, 240 minutes). The significance of the observed trend in
   the data was statistically tested, as was any difference between the
   values at 2 and 3 hours, and the average clearance during the session.
   Results: Urea clearance showed an overall increase from the start of HD
   (by +10.1 +/- 19.3 mL/min, p = 0.0002) while creatinine clearance
   decreased (by -30.7 +/- 17.1 mL/min, p < 10(-4)). For urea, there was,
   however, a significant increase during the first hour (by +26.5 +/- 16.3
   mL/min, p < 10(-4)) which was not observed for creatinine. Starting from
   2 hours, both clearances decreased significantly, but the overall drop
   for creatinine was twice that for urea (by -34.1 +/- 15.7 vs. -16.3 +/-
   19.8 mL/min, p < 10(-4)). As a consequence of these different trends,
   clearance at 2 h, 3 h, and the time-average clearance were not
   significantly different for urea (199.2 +/- 25.9 mL/min, p = 0.18),
   whereas they were so for creatinine (2 h: 115.9 +/- 26.3 mL/min vs. 3 h:
   106.2 +/- 29.2 mL/min vs. average: 109.7 +/- 26.1 mL/min, p < 10(-4)).
   Discussion: A decrease in clearance during HD can be expected because of
   the progressive clogging of the dialyzer membrane's pores. It is not
   clear however the reason for the higher decrease in creatinine compared
   to urea. Our results suggest anyway that the time at which creatinine
   clearance is measured in-vivo should be clearly reported, as the
   difference during the session might be as high as 30\%.
   Objectives: Currently, there are no reliable internal treatment options
   for large segmental bone defects. The objective of this study is to
   develop an alternative treatment for a young male patient with a huge
   180mm diaphyseal tibial bone defect, who was already recommended
   amputation. Methods: A modular add-on system is developed for a
   commercially available motorized bone lengthening nail (Ellipse
   Technolo-gies, USA). The system allows bifocal segmental transport of
   osteotomized bone segments. By this, the bone defect is filled from two
   sides. A wire rope hoist shall ensure that the bone can overcome the
   distance from both sides, which re-duces the time of healing and the
   amount of implanted parts. A 3D-printed model of the patient's bone
   segments helps to design the implant system itself and the handling
   which includes fixation, transport and explantation. Results: The
   results show in accordance to previous studies that the developed
   implant system effectively transports both osteot-omized transport bone
   segments. The wire rope hoist mechanism and the modular construction
   works as planned. The implant system can be explanted successfully.
   Discussion: In this study, we present an individualized modular add-on
   implant solution. The advantage of the modular setup is that many parts
   can be manufactured in universal sizes. This method of bone
   reconstruction could help many patients, who suffer from large critical
   size defects.
   Among the various possible embodiments of Advanced Therapies and in
   particular of Tissue Engineering the use of temporary scaffolds to
   regenerate tissue defects is one of the key issues. The scaffolds should
   be specifically designed to create environments that promote tissue
   development and not merely to support the maintenance of communities of
   cells. To achieve that goal, highly functional scaffolds may combine
   specific morphologies and surface chemistry with the local release of
   bioactive agents. Many biomaterials have been proposed to produce
   scaffolds aiming the regeneration of a wealth of human tissues. We have
   a particular interest in developing systems based in biodegradable
   polymers. Those demanding applications require a combination of
   mechanical properties, processability, cell-friendly surfaces and
   tunable biodegradability that need to be tailored for the specific
   application envisioned. Those biomaterials are usually processed by
   different routes into devices with wide range of morphologies such as
   biodegradable fibers and meshes, films or particles and adaptable to
   different biomedical applications. In our approach, we combine the
   temporary scaffolds populated with therapeutically relevant communities
   of cells to generate a hybrid implant. For that we have explored
   different sources of adult and also embryonic stem cells. We are
   exploring the use of adult MSCs, namely obtained from the bone marrow
   for the development autologous-based therapies. We also develop
   strategies based in extra-embryonic tissues, such as the perivascular
   region of the umbilical cord (Wharton's Jelly). We are currently
   involved in a European consortium aiming at developing films with
   antimicrobial properties to be used in hospitals to cover surfaces that
   are prone to facilitate the transmission of infections. Those films use
   surface topographies and natural-derived oils to ensure the needed
   antibacterial properties to the films. This talk will review our latest
   developments of functionalized biomaterials and scaffolds in combination
   with stem cells for advanced biomedical devices and therapies.
   Objectives: Corwave LVAD is being developed to employ gentle oscillation
   of a membrane to propel blood, based on the wave motion of swimming
   fish. The pump output can be readily tuned by adjusting membrane
   oscillation frequency and magnitude. The purpose of this project was to
   increase the hydraulic efficiency, implement a physiologic pulsatility
   control algorithm, and confirm performance in animal implants. Methods:
   The fluid path of the pump was simulated by Fluid-Structure-Interaction
   (FSI) computational fluid dynamic analysis in COMSOL. Membrane size,
   oscillation frequency, oscillation magnitude, and the blood flow path
   were modeled and refined to improve hydraulic performance and eliminate
   areas of flow stagnation. Pumps were then tested in blood analogs and
   blood in mock circulation loops and in vitro hemolysis testing.
   Non-hermetic prototype pumps were implanted in a total of 25 sheep for
   acute and chronic implants. Results: Design simulations and individual
   component testing resulted in a pump which can generate 6+ LPM of blood
   flow against physiologic pressures with maximum shear rates orders of
   magnitude lower than those of rotary blood pumps. Mock loop testing
   demonstrated the pumps have ``flat{''} HQ (pressure vs. flow) curves.
   Three control methods were developed: fixed, asynchronous pulsatile, and
   synchronous pulsatile. Pulsatile modes generated dP/dt>400 mmHg/s using
   sensorless detection of native ventricle systole. Animal implants
   demonstrated low hemolysis and an absence of renal infarcts, but were
   limited to about a week in duration due to the non-hermetic sealing of
   the pumps. Discussion: Application of robust computational simulation
   and bench top testing have produced a unique new kind of VAD, offering
   the flow capacity and reliability of rotary pumps, but adding
   physiologically relevant pulsatility without excessive shear rates.
   Future efforts will implement full hermeticity to extend animal study
   durations and confirm von Willebrand Factor compatibility.
   Objectives: To investigate the colonization potential of Ovine
   Endothelial Progenitor Cells (OEPCs) on thermoplastic silicone-based
   polyurethane (TSPU) polymer under static condition. Methods:
   Functionalised TSPU (F-TSPU) was prepared by first subjecting the TSPU
   nonwovens to plasma treatment, followed by sterilization with 70\%
   ethanol for seven minutes and then coupling with VEGF under sterile
   conditions. TSPU without any additional treatment or modification,
   identified as NF-TSPU, were used as control. OEPCs were seeded at the
   density of 5x10(4) cell/cm(2) onto square 4 cm(2) sized polymers under
   static conditions. Samples were taken at three time points: 1, 3 and 7
   days. Samples were examined through live/dead staining and scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) to check the progression of cellular
   colonization on the polymer. MTS assay was used to quantify the
   metabolic activity of the cells on the polymer. Results: Cells seeded on
   the polymer surface were clearly visible on the SEM images. On day 3,
   the cells could be observed as patches on surface but did not cover all
   the surface. By day 7, the cells had almost filled the polymer surface.
   In case of F-TSPU, at Day 7, the underlying fiber pattern of the polymer
   could be observed on the cell sheet covering the polymer. Whereas this
   feature was not seen for NF-TSPU, indicating that the cells attached
   firmly to F-TSPU compared to NF-TSPU. Bright green fluorescence was
   observed on samples that underwent live/dead staining, indicating
   presence of live cells. Only a few red spots, representing dead cells,
   were seen. The metabolic activity on NF-TSPU was quantified to be higher
   than in the F-TSPU, though the difference was not statistically
   significant. Discussion: Static cell seeding experiments showed that
   OEPCs were able to attach and grow on the surface of both types of TSPU.
   These are promising results suggesting that TSPU holds potential for
   engineering of a new generation of heart valve prostheses, which will be
   assessed in pre-clinical animal models in the near future.
   Objectives: To investigate the impact of rotational speed modulation on
   VAD hemodynamics by comparing the effects induced by the artificial
   pulse in the HeartMate 3 (HM3, Abbott Laboratories, USA) to those
   induced by the Lavare cycle in the HeartWare HVAD (Medtronic Inc., USA).
   Methods: We compared the effect of speed modulation to a baseline case
   with constant speed and pressure head in both HM3 and HVAD using
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD). CFD simulations employed high
   spatial (10(7) elements) and temporal (2 degrees per time step)
   resolution and one-way coupling to a lumped parameter model (LPM) of the
   cardiovascular system for physiologic boundary conditions. Lagrangian
   particle tracking was implemented to probe viscous and total stresses
   along cell paths. Results were validated against experimental
   pressure-flow (HQ) curves. Results: LPM results showed that HM3 and HVAD
   follow drastically different HQ loops during speed modulation,
   reflecting differences in pump characteristics, modulation rate and
   magnitude and associated fluid inertial effects. In the HM3, pump flow
   varied between -1.2 and 8.8 L/min during the artificial pulse vs. 3.7 to
   7.1 L/min in the HVAD during the Lavare cycle. Induced aortic pressure
   pulses were comparable (11.3 vs 13.2 mmHg). CFD results revealed higher
   baseline shear stresses in the HVAD than in the HM3, coherent with
   previous studies. In both pumps, stresses were highest during flow
   acceleration. Sudden flow deceleration during the artificial pulse
   destabilized the flow and thereby also increased turbulence and total
   stresses on particles. Discussion: While speed modulation may contribute
   to pump wash out and pulsatility, it may also increase flow disturbances
   and shear. By relating shear stress to the rate and magnitude of the
   speed changes, this study sheds light on the impact of the imposed
   accelerations on the stress fields. This is of relevance for the
   establishment of both built-in and physiologically-controlled speed
   modulation sequences.
   Objectives: Thrombotic deposition is a major consideration in the
   development of implantable cardiovascular devices. Recently, it has been
   demonstrated that fluid mechanical shear micro-gradients play a critical
   role in thrombogenesis. The goal of the present work is to develop a
   predictive computational model of platelet activation and deposition
   that can be used to assess the thrombotic burden of cardiovascular
   devices. We have developed a comprehensive model of platelet-mediated
   thrombogenesis which includes platelet transport in the blood flow,
   platelet activation induced by both agonists generated at sites of
   vascular injury and shear micro-gradients, kinetics and mechanics of
   platelet adhesion, and changes in the local fluid dynamics due to the
   growth of a thrombus. Methods: A 2D computational model was developed
   using the multi-physics finite element solver COMSOL 5.3a. The model can
   be described by a coupled set of convection-diffusion-reaction
   equations, and it comprises 7 species: resting and activated platelets,
   agonists that induce thrombosis, and an anticoagulant agent. Platelet
   adhesion at the surface was modeled via flux boundary conditions. Using
   a moving mesh for the surface, thrombus growth and consequent
   alterations in blood flow were modeled. In the case of a stenosis, the
   notions of shear stress-induced platelet activation in the acceleration
   zone and platelet deposition in the expansion zone downstream of the
   stenosis were studied. Results: The model provides the spatial and
   temporal evolution of thrombosis in the flow field. The computed density
   of platelets adherent to the surface was validated against experimental
   data. The results confirm the importance of considering both mechanical
   and chemical activation of platelets. Discussion: The developed model
   represents a potentially useful tool for the optimization of the design
   of the cardiovascular device flow path.
   Objectives: The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of glucose
   concentration in the culture medium on metabolism and viability of the
   human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) co-cultured with the
   human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells (HUASMC) on polysulfone
   semipermeable flat membranes. Methods: Cells were isolated from
   umbilical veins and arteries obtained by Caesarean section. Membranes
   with a surface area of 2 cm2 were covered with fibronectin to promote
   cells' attachment and then were placed in specially designed inserts.
   Cultures were carried out in 12-well plates filled with culture medium
   containing glucose in normal (5 mM) or high (20 mM) concentration. The
   HUVEC and HUASMC were seeded on separate membranes or on both sides of
   the same membrane with density of 4,600 cells/cm2. Cultures have been
   conducted in standard conditions (37oC, 5\% CO2) for 7 days. Activity of
   the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell viability were analyzed using
   the flow cytometry (with DCFDA test and Annexin V / 7AAD test,
   respectively). Microscopic visualization of cells was made after
   fixation in formalin using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Results: In
   the HUVEC co-cultured with HUASMC the ROS activity was lower by 17\% in
   the normal than in high glucose concentration. In normal glucose
   concentration the ROS activity of the HUVEC co-cultured with HUASMC was
   lower by 8\% than in HUVEC cultured separately, whereas in high glucose
   concentration it was higher by 19\%. Viability of HUVEC cultured
   separately in normal glucose concentration was higher by 4\% than in
   high glucose concentration. Microscopic visualization of cells did not
   reveal any morphological differences. Discussion: In terms of the ROS
   activity the obtained preliminary results indicate a beneficial effect
   of HUASMC on HUVEC co-cultured in normal glucose concentration. The
   opposite tendency was observed in high glucose concentration.
   Objectives: Continuous rhythm monitoring is useful for predicting,
   determining and treating a large class of diseases. An implantable heart
   monitor is useful for this purpose. it has small dimensions and records
   events over a timeframe measured in years. The objective of the study is
   to develop methods and algorithms for determining QRS-complexes and
   disorders in the work of the heart. Methods: Several sources were used
   to obtain the ECG: large collections of recorded physiologic signals
   PhysioBank and BioModule BioHarness 3. Records of database have
   annotations with tags of QRS-complexes and conclusions of doctors.
   BioModule BioHarness 3 record lead V4 or V5 dependent on position
   electrodes. Sampling frequency is 1000 Hz. The records were made on the
   basis of I.M.Sechenov University Clinical Hospital No.1, Russia. The
   monitor of physiological parameters and the device for daily monitoring
   of ECG was installed by the patient simultaneously. Recording was
   carried out for 24 hours simultaneously on both instruments. The device
   for daily monitoring of ECG is used to determine the sensitivity and
   specificity of the developed methods. MATLAB was used to implement
   algorithms. Results: Testing the algorithm with PhisioNet database
   resulted in a mean sensitivity of 99.21\% and a mean specificity of
   99.49\%. Testing the algorithm with Biomodule 3 resulted in a mean
   sensitivity of 99.02\% and a mean specificity of 93.69\%. 16 records
   were analyzed. The analyzer gave an incorrect result in 2 cases.
   Discussion: A careful study of records revealed that algorithm sets
   false tags in the absence of contact between the electrodes and the
   surface of the human body. The device for daily monitoring of ECG
   continues to operate normally at the same time. A careful study of the
   annotations PhysioNet showed that they contain errors. Some records have
   been shortened or excluded for this reason.
   Objectives: The aim of this paper is to improve the design of the
   current commercial cannula being used by clinicians in order to minimise
   the blood flow stasis and thus avoid thrombosis in ECMO drainage cannula
   Methods: A CFD simulation is used in order to determine the optimum
   desing for the drainage cannula. The improved cannula design was
   fabricated and validated in-vitro using particle image velocimetry.
   Results: 16 different cannula designs were simulated and results were
   analysed in terms of velocity and mass flow rate at side holes and
   different sections of the cannula. Different parameters including side
   holes diameter, number, spacing, distance to the cannula tip, and angle
   relative to flow direction were investigated. Simulation results were in
   agreement with PIV. Discussion: This study demonstrated that the
   improved drainage cannula can significantly reduce blood flow stasis,
   and potentially thrombosis, in patients receiving ECMO.
   Objectives: The aim of this work was to study the influence of the
   constructive and personal characteristics of the wireless energy
   transfer system on the temperature distribution in biological tissues.
   The basic parameters of the transcutaneous energy transfer system, such
   as transmitted power, efficiency and displacements, were taken into
   account. The patient's personal characteristics, such as the thickness
   of biological tissue layers, were also taken into account. To obtain
   data on the level of thermal damage, Henriques and Moritz study was
   used. Methods: The temperature data was obtained using the numerical
   solution of a bioheat equation by the finite element method. This
   article mathematically evaluates thermal injury based on Henriques and
   Moritz study, in which damage can be represented as the speed of a
   chemical process. Results: The temperature distributions in the tissues
   corresponding to the following types of displacements were obtained:
   axial, lateral, angular and also for the case where there are no
   displacements. Also the temperature distributions in tissues with
   different structures were obtained. Further, the temperature values at
   the maximum heating points were used to estimate thermal damage to the
   tissues. Discussion: It was established that when a wireless energy
   transfer system is operated without displacements, the severity of
   thermal injury does not exceed the threshold corresponding to a
   first-degree burn. It was also found that the patient's personal
   characteristics are influenced by the temperature distribution in the
   case when a change in the thickness of a layer of biological tissue
   occurs in the region of the nearest heat source.
   Objectives: The objective of this work is the development of a two-phase
   blood model fluid for the use in upscaled flow models. In large scaled
   models of different flow geometries, frequently used water-glycerol
   mixtures are not sufficient because in critical regions with small gaps,
   e.g. between the rotor and the wall in cardiac support systems, the
   two-phases of blood have a great influence on the flow. Therefore, it is
   necessary that the model fluid represents both phases of blood: the
   plasma and the cells. Methods: Transparent alginate beads were used as a
   model of red blood cells. A water-glycerol mixture was used as a model
   fluid for plasma. The alginate beads made up about 40 \% of the volume
   to model the proper hematocrit. Furthermore, the beads have a slightly
   higher density than the surrounding medium and keep floating once in
   motion. This was achieved by embedding hollow glass particles in the
   spheres that have a density <1.0 kg/l, also enabling particle tracking
   and flow analysis using the Particle Image Velocimetry method. A camera
   tracks the flow path of the beads through the required geometry.
   Reynolds similarity was maintained. Results: Flow analysis has been
   performed in an upscaled model of blade and gap of a ventricular assist
   device. Compared to a water-glycerol mixture, the proposed blood model
   fluid enabled the visualization of the strong influence of the two
   phases on the flow. Because of their transparency, it was possible to
   visualize the flow field at several layers in the fluid by choosing the
   appropriate light sections. Discussion: The proposed blood model fluid
   showed promising results in an initial case. Moreover, the results of
   the experiment lead to a possible optimization of the geometry of future
   rotor blades in blood pumps in order to reduce hemolysis. Further
   channel geometries will be explored. In the long term, the model can be
   used for experiments on flow analysis and optimization in blood pumps or
   as a validation model for CFD-codes to calculate multiphase flows.
   Objectives: FTR, the death rate among patients with complications, is an
   emerging quality metric, that has received an increasing focus in the
   last years. Concerning the management and outcome in life-threatening
   complications due to ECMO-insertion there are only few reports
   available. We report the successful rescue therapy in two patients of
   our hospitals large ECMO-patient cohort with severe ARDS who experienced
   right ventricular (RV)-perforation after v-v-ECMO-cannula insertion by
   the Seldinger's wire. Methods: RV perforation was assumed by
   deteriorating hemodynamics and immediate echo-cardiography showing
   cardiac tamponade during ECMO-cannula insertion. In cases of two
   patients an immediate bedside sternotomy was performed and the diagnosis
   verified. The source of bleeding was controlled and the tamponade was
   cleared. Either patient was transferred to the OR after ROSC for a
   definitive hemostasis and subsequent optimally controlled cannula
   placement. Results: Both patients survived this life-threatening event
   without neurological complications or further bleeding as well as no
   infections of the wounds. In Patient 1 the ECMO-therapy was not
   instituted immediately but later. This patient was weaned from ECMO
   after one week, survived six months but finally died due to an
   underlying disease. In Patient 2 switching the v-v- to an a-v-ECMO in
   the acute setting lead to a sufficient circulation during CPR. This
   patient was completely weaned from ECMO after 2 weeks and was finally
   discharged to rehabilitation after two months. Discussion: Successful
   management of seriously complicated ECMO- insertion is possible. The
   provision of an immediate bedside operative therapy and every kind of
   circulatory support to achieve ROSC seem to be essential in this
   setting. By reason of this concept a No-FTR situation could be achieved,
   which depicts a positive marker for quality of care for ECMO patients.
   Objectives: Blood trauma is an unintended consequence of mechanical
   circulatory support. Evidence indicates that exposure to high shears may
   induce sublethal changes to blood cells and also overt cell destruction.
   To determine whether such changes in blood properties have a functional
   impact on microcirculatory function, we examined the effect of surgery
   requiring cardiopulmonary bypass on the rheological properties of blood
   and also direct assessments of cell flux in the microcirculation.
   Methods: Thirty individuals requiring elective coronary artery bypass
   graft (n = 15) or valve surgery (n = 15) volunteered to participate.
   Dependent variables were collected prior to use of cardiopulmonary
   bypass, after 60 min of being on pump, and in the post-surgical period.
   Blood analyses included measurements of blood and plasma viscosity, red
   cell deformability, red cell aggregability, mechanical sensitivity of
   red cells, and levels of haemolysis, among others. Microcirculatory
   function was assessed using incident dark field visualisation of the
   sublingual vessels. Results and Discussion: Initial findings of this
   project indicate that blood viscosity and red cell aggregability are
   significantly affected by 60 min of cardiopulmonary bypass; these
   measures do not restore following the early post-surgical period.
   Microcirculatory assessments reveal altered transit and velocities of
   red cells, potentially indicating a link between biophysical assessments
   of blood and microcirculatory function. Extended presentation of this
   ongoing study will be presented, and discussed in the context of the
   secondary complications that still plague circulatory support patients.
   Objectives: Granulocyte and monocyte apheresis (GMA), in which
   granulocytes and monocytes are removed from the patient's whole blood,
   is used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The
   objective of the present study was to clarify the effects of the
   anticoagulation methods used on blood clot formation in the column
   during GMA. Methods: Extracorporeal circulation was established for 60
   minutes in male Sprague Dawley rats. A small column filled with 0.7 g of
   cellulose diacetate beads was used. We administered heparin at a total
   dose of 0.5 U/g by 2 different administration methods: the bolus
   administration method (single bolus administration prior to
   extracorporeal circulation) and the half bolus and half continuous
   administration method. During extracorporeal circulation the arterial
   pressure, column inlet pressure, venous pressure, and activated clotting
   time (ACT) were measured. The hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of the
   eluate of the residual clots was measured after the extracorporeal
   circulation. Results: Extracorporeal circulation was performed stably
   for 60 minutes without events like in-circuit coagulation, in both
   groups. The ACT reached its peak value within 30 minutes in the bolus
   administration group, to decline gradually thereafter; on the other
   hand, in the half bolus and half continuous administration group, the
   ACT remained nearly constant during the extracorporeal circulation. The
   Hb concentration in the eluate was significantly lower in the bolus
   administration group than in the half bolus and half continuous
   administration group. Discussion: The results indicated that even for
   the same total dose of heparin, clot formation in the column was
   influenced by the method of administration. We concluded that bolus
   administration of heparin, which led to early peaking of the ACT value
   was more effective to reduce residual blood clotting in the column as
   compared to half bolus and half continuous administration.
   Objectives: Suction at the inlet of a Left Ventricular Assist Device
   (LVAD) is common and known to cause adverse events. It occurs when
   tissue is drawn towards the cannula, thus leading to a reduced or even
   ceased flow. Moreover, the sudden occlusion can cause flow situations
   inside the device to be dramatically different from typical operation.
   The objectives were to quantify the effect of suction on the rotor
   bearing of an LVAD in an advanced development status and to mitigate
   unfavorable effects on the ongoing therapy and pump performance.
   Methods: A custom-made suction module was integrated into an
   established, active mock circulation loop upstream of an LVAD. This
   module comprises a membrane that can occlude the inflow cannula
   depending on the pressure in its fluid chamber relative to an adjustable
   air pressure chamber. The LVAD is equipped with rotor position sensors
   for online position tracking. Suction was initiated by reducing venous
   return and thus pump inlet pressure or by actively increasing air
   pressure in the respective chamber. The tests were performed with active
   and inactive suction speed control algorithms. Results: Spontaneous
   suction by reducing venous return was unlikely for the LVAD under test
   independently of the stationary air pressure applied. By actively
   provoking suction, increased radial force on the rotor was observed with
   uncharacteristic movement of the rotor. The radial gap remained
   satisfactory for all operational points and patient scenarios
   investigated. Suction was accurately detected by the controller and the
   speed reduced accordingly, thus leading to a relieve of the suction
   event. Discussion: Ventricular suction is a critical event in two ways
   as it negatively affects the LVAD therapy and secondly provokes
   uncharacteristic forces that might be critical for device performance.
   Future research is needed to ensure that experimental models of suction
   represent the variety of supported ventricles accurately.
   Objectives: Human amniotic membrane (AM) is employed in a broad field of
   applications as a wound dressing, corneal treatment, and scaffolding
   material. However, mechanical properties of native membranes vary
   depending on the zone of the placenta where the AM is obtained. For this
   reason, mimicking the AM through tissue engineering is a way to obtain a
   membrane with standardized properties. One technique to mimic the
   morphology of the extracellular matrix of AM is electrospinning. With
   electrospinning, a nanometric arranged similarly to the AM extracellular
   matrix made of different polymeric blends could be obtained. In
   addition, the correct storage is a key point in order to guarantee the
   availability of such tissue-engineered constructs for clinical
   applications. Methods: The AM extract is first prepared from native
   material and then freeze-dried. Afterwards, the AM-based scaffolds are
   obtained using blend electrospinning of polyethylene oxide and
   freeze-dried AM. Structural and compositional properties are assessed by
   scanning electron microscopy and confocal Raman spectroscopy. The
   mechanical properties are evaluated by static mechanical testing before
   and after cryopreservation. The scaffold is then seeded with multipotent
   stromal cells. The biocompatibility of the tissue-engineered AM is
   analyzed using cytotoxicity assay. Results: The tissue-engineered
   membrane presents a nanostructured morphology similar to the
   extracellular matrix of AM. The compositional results can detect the
   presence of collagen, fibronectin and hyaluronic acid in the final
   material. Preliminary results present changes in the mechanical
   properties related to the cryopreservation. The fabrication technique
   for the tissue-engineered AM seemed not to alter the biocompatibility
   with stem cells. Discussion: The AM is ideal for treatment of different
   tissues, and in combination with polymeric materials by electrospinning,
   it could be a suitable candidate for a tissue-engineered membrane with
   standardized properties.
   Objectives: A mixed flow blood pump with an outer casing diameter of 9
   mm is proposed as part of an intracorporeal membrane oxygenator. The
   usage of a blood pump deals with major challenges in the design of an
   intravenous device, specifically overcoming the pressure drop and
   enabling a controllable blood flow. This study presents the design,
   manufacturing, experimental and numerical investigation of the pump
   prototype. Methods: The pump prototype was manufactured using a Kudo3D
   Titan 1 (Kudo3D Inc. Dublin, USA) 3D printer, utilizing liquid photo
   polymeric resin coupled with a digital light processing (DLP) curing
   process. A static test loop consisting of the pump, ultrasonic flow
   sensor and pressure sensors was used to obtain the pump characteristics
   at different rotational speeds ranging from 23000 to 32000 rpm. A water
   glycerol mixture with a dynamic viscosity of 3.4 mPa.s was selected as
   working fluid. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were
   carried out using the open source CFD code OpenFOAM (R). Results: Over
   the investigated range from 30 to 500 mmHg, stable characteristic curves
   at different rotational speeds were measured. At 27700 rpm, a flow rate
   of 1.4 L/min against a pressure difference of 174 mmHg was observed. CFD
   simulations show a good agreement of the numerically predicted and
   measured pump characteristics, with an average deviation of about 8 \%.
   Discussion: The applied manufacturing process was capable to produce
   thin structured, complex parts down to 300 mu m wall thickness, durable
   enough to be used in experimental investigations up to 32000 rpm.
   Experimental pump characteristics show adequate performance of the
   proposed mixed flow pump for the intended purpose. CFD simulations
   accurately match the experimental pressure difference.
   Objectives: Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is a technique to evaluate
   lungs before transplantation. As a tool for experimental research, this
   method allows organ modification and assessment. However, the costs are
   high. The aim of this study was to establish a low-cost EVLP model on
   the one hand and to investigate the feasibility of surgical graft
   downsizing during EVLP on the other hand. We compared a lobectomy, a
   stapled wedge and a sutured wedge resection during EVLP. Methods: Pigs
   of 60 kg weight were used for organ harvesting. After cardiac death
   lungs were retrieved, flushed with Perfadex and perfused with autologous
   blood for 4 hours of EVLP. The circuit was assembled from an ECMO system
   consisting of a Deltastream DP2 pump (Medos), an Affinity Fusion
   oxygenator (Medtronic) and a hardshell reservoir. After 90 minutes of
   perfusion a lobectomy was performed. At intervals of 30 minutes, a
   stapled wedge resection and a sutured wedge resection were performed.
   Air leak and the loss of blood were measured. The function of the lung
   was monitored including pulmonary artery pressure and blood gas
   analysis. Results: 20 porcine lungs were used to establish a stable
   model. Another 7 lungs underwent surgical interventions. The blood loss
   after lobectomy (3,14 +/- 4,14 ml/min) and after stapled wedge resection
   (5,29 +/- 8,1 ml/min) was lower than after sutured wedge resection (33
   +/- 17,36 ml/min). There was no major difference in air leak after the
   surgical interventions (lobectomy: 0,06 +/- 0,16 l/min vs. stapler: 0,03
   +/- 0,09 l/min vs. suture: 0,04 +/- 0,1 l/min). The oxygenation
   performance was satisfactory. The pulmonary artery pressure was in a
   physiological range. Bleeding into the parenchyma after suture was
   higher compared to the other interventions. Discussion: The low-cost
   custom-made EVLP model presented here is feasible and stable. Surgical
   interventions during EVLP are possible. Performing a lobectomy and a
   wedge resection is superior to a wedge resection with suture regarding
   to the blood loss.
   Objectives: Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) possess an
   exceptional differentiation potential, as they are able to differentiate
   towards cells from all three germ layers. Owing to this capability, they
   are an attractive cell source for regenerative medicine applications and
   in vitro disease models. To date, coated substrates with Matrigel (R)
   and Geltrex (TM) have been providing promising platforms for hiPSC
   culture and differentiation. Besides many advantages, both substrates
   provide some drawbacks such as batch-to-batch variation and xenogeneic
   origin, which pose problems in potential clinical applications. To
   tackle these issues, a matrigel-mimetic synthetic biomaterial able to
   maintain hiPSCs in culture is required. Cell behavior is controlled by a
   complex set of biophysical (e.g. stiffness) as well as biological (e.g.
   growth factors) parameters. In this study, we want to develop a fully
   synthetic hiPSC-supporting hydrogel that allows investigating the
   influence of biophysical and biological parameters on hiPSCs. Methods:
   The substrates were prepared via crosslinking starPEG and heparin
   molecules with different molar ratios. Substrates were biofunctionalized
   with two methods based on NHS ester binding to amine groups of laminins
   in different ratios. hiPSCs were seeded on substrates and the medium was
   changed every day. Cells were stained after 72 hours for pluripotency
   markers (OCT4-SSEA4). Results: Functionalized substrates with storage
   modulus of 4kPa maintained hiPSCs culture. On the other hand, no
   adherent cells were observed on the substrates with a storage modulus of
   1kPa and 10kPa. Discussion: StarPEG-heparin hydrogels functionalized
   with laminin mixtures clearly represented an appropriate
   matrigel-mimetic growth substrate for the hiPSC culture and maintenance
   of their pluripotency. 3D cultures have already been shown to be
   superior to 2D and it is an outlook of this work.
   Objectives: Radiological procedures utilizing intravascular iodinated
   contrast media are being widely applied for both diagnostic and
   therapeutic purposes and represent one of the main causes of
   contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN).In this hospital-based study we tried
   to assess predictors for the development of CIN in patients undergoing
   cardiac catheterization. Methods: A total of 5604 patients undergoing
   coronary angiogram/PCI from 2007-2017 were enrolled in the study.
   Multivariate predictors of CIN were identified by logistic regression
   using stepwise selection with entry and exit criteria of p < 0.1. A
   two-sided 95\% confidence interval (CI) was constructed around the point
   estimate of the odds (OR). A p value Results: CIN occurred in 6 (1 parts
   per thousand) patients. The mean age of patients suffering from CIN was
   higher than in the whole population (66.5 +/- 31.15 vs. 58.66 +/- 28.57,
   p=0.03). Characteristics of patients who developed CIN were: older age,
   diabetes, higher creatinine and lower EF. The incidence of CIN in
   patients with diabetes was higher and statistically significant (84\%
   vs. 16\%, p=0.01). Emergency cases were at higher risk of developing CIN
   than elective patients (85\% vs.15\%, p=0.001), respectively. Diabetes,
   CKD and EF < 50\% were independent predictors of CIN (RR 2.4, 95\% CI:
   1.88 - 7.132, p=0.008; RR 3.1, 95\% CI: 2.17 - 6.682, p=0.003; RR 1.6,
   95\% CI: 2.88 - 7.132, p=0.01, respectively). Discussion: The
   development of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients who underwent
   angiography and PCI was mainly related to older age, diabetes, lower GFR
   and heart failure, but not contrast material exposure.
   Objectives: To examine the efficacy of the short-time total liquid
   ventilation (TLV) with oxygen micro/nano bubble dispersed saline for
   severe and lethal respiratory failure (experiment 1 and 2, respectively)
   induced by intratracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
   Methods: In experiment 1, fifteen rats were divided into three groups:
   LPS+TLV group (treatment group) received 5-min TLV 20 min after LPS (5
   mg/kg) administration, LPS+MGV group received 5-min mechanical gas
   ventilation (MGV) after the LPS administration, and PBS+MGV group
   received 5-min MGV 20 min after administration of phosphate buffered
   saline (PBS) instead of LPS. Ventilation weaning was performed after
   respiratory management for three hours. At two days after each
   treatment, hemodynamics and blood gas parameters were measured and the
   rats were subsequently sacrificed. The excised lungs were used for
   histological analysis and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In experiment 2,
   ten rats were divided into two groups: LPS+TLV group and LPS+MGV group.
   Ten mg/kg LPS was used for inducing lethal acute lung injury and the
   survival rate was used for the primary outcome. Results: In experiment
   1, significant differences were confirmed between LPS+TLV group and
   LPS+MGV group in the value of blood oxygen, weight loss ratio, and
   inflammatory cytokines levels in BAL-fluid (p < 0.05). On the other
   hand, there was a significant difference only in arterial oxygen
   pressure between LPS+TLV group and PBS+MGV group. Severe inflammation in
   LPS+MGV group was also confirmed in the histological analysis. In
   experiment 2, all rats in LPS+MGV group died within two days, whereas
   80\% of the rats in LPS+TLV group survived for one week. Moreover, the
   conditions of the survival rats showed normal in the pulmonary function
   and the alveolar structure after one week. Discussion: It is indicated
   that 5-min TLV with oxygen micro/nano bubble dispersed saline after LPS
   administration prevented severe respiratory failure and improved the
   survival rate dramatically without any disorders.
   Objectives: Natural biological tissues have electrical conductivities
   and it is required that artificial tissues also possessed such a
   property. We investigated the specific conductivity (s) of the
   bionanomaterial in the composition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and
   single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). Methods: We investigated the
   specific conductivity (s) of the bionanomaterial in the composition of
   bovine serum albumin (BSA) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT).
   The aqueous dispersion contained 25 wt.\% BSA, 0.45 wt.\% SWCNT.
   Dispersion on silicon substrates was applied by screen printing. After
   drying, the formed layers had approximate sizes: area - 5'20 mm2,
   thickness - 5 15mm. For all samples the dependence of s on temperature t
   was recorded when they were in a thermostat. The s(t) curves were taken
   with a numerous cycle n = 1 5 with increasing and decreasing
   temperatures in the region of t 20 45 degrees C. Results: The following
   data was obtained. With increasing n, the values of s and the hysteresis
   on s(t) decreased: at n = 1 - s 0.11 S/m, temperature resistance
   coefficient a -0.004 K-1, hysteresis on s(t), i.e. R/R0 0.90, where R0
   is the initial resistance, R is the final resistance; at n = 5 - s 36
   S/m, a -0.002 K-1, R/R0 0.95. Spectral studies in the optical range did
   not reveal any changes in the sample before and after a cyclic thermal
   action, which underlines the stability of BSA. Thus, in the layers of
   the BSA/SWCNT the s increases and the hysteresis on s(t) decreases with
   n = 1 5. Apparently, this behavior is associated with an increase in the
   number of contacts between nanotubes in the albumin matrix. Discussion:
   The studied layers of the composite bionanomaterial (BSA/SWCNT) has an
   acceptable value of specific conductivity (1,10 S/m) and mechanical
   properties (hardness 300 MPa) and is promising for biomedical
   applications.
   Objectives: Determine the outcomes and survival of patients who receive
   a temporary total artificial heart (TAH) as bridge to transplant or as
   bridge to decision by evaluating data from the Interagency Registry for
   Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) database in the
   U.S. Methods: Review of the INTERMACS database between 2006 and April
   2017 revealed a total of 450 patients had been implanted. The data was
   reviewed to determine survival rates, adverse events, and competing
   outcomes. Risk factors for mortality were determined using hazard
   function analysis. Results: Data from 450 patients (87\% men; mean age,
   50 years) were available in the INTERMACS database. The 2 most common
   diagnoses were dilated cardiomyopathy (50\%) and ischemic cardiomyopathy
   (20\%). Risk factors for right heart failure were present in 82\% of
   patients. Most patients were INTERMACS Profile 1 (43\%) or 2 (37\%) at
   implantation. There were 266 patients who eventually underwent
   transplantation, and 162 died. Overall 3-, 6-, and 12-month actuarial
   survival rates were 73\%, 62\%, and 53\%, respectively. Risk factors for
   death included older age (p = 0.001), need for pre-implantation dialysis
   (p = 0.006), higher creatinine (p = 0.008) and lower albumin (p < 0.001)
   levels, and implantation at a low-volume center (<= 10 TAHs; p < 0.001).
   Competing-outcomes analysis showed 71\% of patients in high-volume
   centers were alive on the device or had undergone transplantation at 12
   months after TAH implantation vs 57\% in low-volume centers (p = 0.003).
   Discussion: Patients receiving TAHs have rapidly declining cardiac
   function and require prompt intervention. Experienced centers have
   better outcomes, likely related to patient selection, timing of
   implantation, patient care, and device management. Organized transfer of
   knowledge to low-volume centers could improve outcomes
   Objectives: To analyze the hemodynamic effect of ventricular assist
   devices using a multi-scale mathematical model of the human
   extracellular fluid system. Methods: A Ventricular Assist Device (VAD)
   model has been incorporated into the Digital Avatar, a multi-scale,
   closed-loop mathematical model of the human fluid system is composed of
   a network of major arteries, major veins, and lumped parameter models
   for the heart, pulmonary circulation, arterioles, capillaries, venules,
   cerebrospinal fluid and brain interstitial fluid. The mathematical model
   relies on one-dimensional PDEs for blood vessels and on ODEs for lumped
   parameter models. Results: Based on the model, we have quantified the
   hemodynamics of the systemic circulation with and without the medical
   device in healthy and unhealthy scenarios. Results will be shown at the
   conference. Discussion: Traditionally, bench testing, animal studies and
   clinical trials are used as the main source of evidence for getting
   medical devices on the market in the US. The associated costs and time
   are enormous and represent a burden for MedTech companies. In addition,
   the FDA wants to minimize animal and human study testing. In recent
   years, Computational Modelling and Simulation (CM\&S) has made huge
   steps forward. CM\&S are a valuable regulatory tool for its significant
   cost-savings in evaluating medical devices, simulating performance under
   scenarios that may not be possible with human use and quantifying the
   safety and efficacy of medical devices. However, the existing CM\&S
   tools are highly specialized for each field and do not provide a
   platform that integrates all human body mechanisms. Computational Life's
   vision is to replicate all body mechanisms into a single, integrated
   software called Digital Avatar platform. The Digital Avatar platform
   will enable MedTech companies to perform feasibility testing and
   quantify the safety and the efficacy of (ideally) any type of medical
   device. Here we will show an application with the VAD system.
   Objectives: Three-dimensional (3D) in vitro cultivation systems have
   gained increased attention, since using these systems allows the precise
   study of mammalian cell physiology, intercellular interaction, as well
   as cell-matrix interactions. Another important cell culture parameter,
   often neglected in traditional cultivation, is the concentration of
   dissolved oxygen. Generally, cell culture is performed under ambient
   oxygen saturation (21\%), while the oxygen amount available in vivo in
   human tissue is much lower (1\% to 15\%). The stiffness of in vivo
   tissues and in vitro constructs also plays a crucial role in cell fate
   and physiology. Methods: Semi-synthetic hydrogels with tunable
   properties allow creating a wide range of in vitro material stiffness.
   The development of hydrogel-based 3D cell culture gradient systems
   enables to obtain complex, but precisely defined in vitro
   microenvironments, which in turn allow a systematic investigation of the
   influence of microenvironmental conditions. Oxygen gradients in 3D and
   2D cell culture can be created with the help of incubation chambers.
   Results: Encapsulation of mesenchymal stem cells containing fluorescent
   hypoxia sensors reveals specific conditions where the hypoxic response
   is activated and determines the influence of hydrogel stiffness on the
   hypoxic response. In the presented study, exact correlations between in
   situ O2 concentrations in 3D cell cultures (hydrogels and microtissues)
   and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) activation are disclosed for the
   first time. Discussion: Creating stable in vitro oxygen gradients in 3D
   hydrogel-based cultures with stiffness variety helps to better
   understand and predict cell behavior (survival, cytokine expression,
   spontaneous differentiation of stem cells or migration capacity) in
   physiological and pathological in vivo conditions, as well as to find
   optimal conditions to simulate the in vivo cell niche.
   Objectives: Most breast and prostate cancers metastasize to the bone. To
   establish macrometastases, the disseminated tumor cells (DTC) need to
   have stem cell-like properties such as self-renewal and differentiation
   into other tumor cells. They compete with hematopoietic stem and
   progenitor cells (HSPC) and mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) for
   their specific microenvironment or `niches'. Apart from biochemical
   factors in niches, biophysical cues also influence such interactions.
   The aim of this project is to investigate the intercellular crosstalk
   that occurs among these cells and the signalling pathways in a 3D porous
   hydrogel that was previously established in our group. Methods: The
   hydrogel mimics in structure the trabecular region of the bone marrow.
   Cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions will be investigated using
   fluorescence imaging techniques. The pathways will be analyzed with the
   help of Western blots and specific inhibitors. Cytokine array and ELISA
   will be used for assessing auto- and paracrine communication via soluble
   factors. The biophysical parameters such as the 3D architecture and
   mechanical properties will also be tuned and their effect studied.
   Results: The coculture of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 with
   bone marrow-derived MSCs and the leukemic cell line KG-1a reveal
   formation of spheroid-like structures in the gels. Experiments are being
   performed to study the cell-cell interactions within these structures.
   Parallel experiments are being carried out regarding the effect of the
   3D architecture, which will be introduced by varying the porosity of the
   gel. Discussion: The results of these studies will help us to develop in
   vitro models of different tumor cell niches that will allow us in
   gaining a fundamental insight into the early events of bone metastasis.
   Tuning these parameters in the 3D bone marrow analog, we can have an
   understanding about how the biophysical cues affect the cellular
   activities.
   Objectives: Bioartificial liver devices aim to replace the
   detoxification and metabolic functions of the liver in people with liver
   failure. Shear stress and local velocities created by flow inside porous
   scaffolds need to be optimised to improve cell viability and avoid
   inflammation, however there are no relevant studies on the topic to
   date. Here, fluid dynamics inside porous cryogels were characterised
   using a purpose-built micro-PIV system. The aims were to develop a
   micro-PIV setup to record the flow inside cryogel structure and to
   characterise the nature of flow inside the cryogel channels by video
   post-processing in order to determine inlet design. Methods: HEMA- based
   cryogels were synthesised by cryogelation technique and the
   microstructure was analysed by SEM, confocal microscope and mu CT. Open
   porosity, overall porosity and permeability were extrapolated from mu
   CT. A mu PIV set up was developed to visualise flow inside cryogels
   which was composed of a digital camera with a long-distance microscope
   objective, a pulsating LED light source, a pump and an optical chamber
   to host the cryogel. Glass beads of 10 mu m size were used as tracers to
   mimic red blood cells. Videos were analysed with PIVlab in Matlab which
   allowed the interpolation of local velocities. Results: Cryogels
   possessed an open porosity, with pore size up to 100 mu m, as well as an
   interconnected network of pores, making it suitable for a perfused
   system. Fluid dynamics were optimized using a mu PIV setup which allows
   for the visualisation of flow inside the cryogel channels. Discussion:
   Videos showed that internal flow did not reorganize itself through the
   channels and was found to be laminar with Re < 1 with low vorticity.
   This suggests that molecules and toxins of the blood in the centre of a
   channel would not interact with hepatocytes seeded on the cryogel pore
   walls. Hence, flow reorganization could be promoted through a layered
   bioreactor. A layered cryogel structure was introduced to improve flow
   characteristics and improve toxin/hepatocyte interaction.
   Objectives: Generation of a large-scale stem cell derived bioartificial
   cardiac tissue (BCT) as a potential therapeutic option to replace
   damaged myocardium after myocardial infarction. Methods: Large-scale BCT
   was generated from cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from human induced
   pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) mixed with human fibroblasts and a
   hydrogel solution in a newly designed tissue chamber with a diameter of
   43 mm. The BCT development was microscopically recorded and evaluated.
   Maturation of CMs within the tissue was confirmed by immunofluorescence
   staining for cardiac markers (alpha-SA, cTnT) as well as cell junction
   proteins (Con. 43, N-Cad). The integration of the tissue chamber in the
   novel custom-made bioreactor allowed investigating the initial
   parameters for electromechanical stimulation (such as pressure, stress
   amplitude, frequency) necessary for proper tissue maturation in a more
   physiological manner. To investigate the calcium handling through the
   tissue a new transgenic hiPSC line containing a genetically encoded
   calcium indicator (GCaMP6f) has been developed. Results: Microscopically
   evaluation at different time points reveals a progressive reduction of
   nearly 27\% of the initial volume after 15 days, ccorresponding with an
   increased intercellular connectivity. After 48h, the tissue exhibited
   spontaneous contractions and coordinated and rhythmic contraction within
   the whole tissue after 6 days. As preliminary analysis, the beating of
   the tissue was video-optically recorded showing an estimated beating
   rate of 102 beats per minute. Immunofluorescence staining performed at
   day 15 showed highly organised cross-striations of sarcomere proteins.
   Initial integration of the tissue chamber in the bioreactor and
   implementation of the new GCaMP6f reporter cell line is still on-going.
   Discussion: The initial results confirmed that is possible to generate a
   large-scale BCT. However, the properties of the tissue have to be
   further investigated.
   Objectives: The Fontan procedure is performed for univentricular
   correction of the heart in pediatric patients with tricuspid atresia. In
   the Fontan circulation, the veins connect directly to the pulmonary
   artery. However, as a result of the procedure the load on the single
   functional ventricle of the heart and veins increases. Eventually,
   patients need a heart transplantation. A possible solution to the
   circulation deficiencies of the Fontan patients could be the ventricular
   assist device (VAD). The VAD is implanted between veins and the
   pulmonary artery. The aim of this study is to develop a model of the
   Fontan circulation with VAD support. Methods: We use mathematical models
   to reduce the time and resources spent on in vivo research. Nonlinear
   mathematical models represent sections of the cardiovascular system
   (CVS) in the form of blocks. Pressure variations in the CVS sections are
   described by a system of differential equations. Results: Appling VAD to
   the Fontan patients exhibits the potential to increase the venous return
   of blood. According to the Frank-Starling law, the stroke volume
   increases with increasing venous return. VAD creates a necessary
   pressure differential between the venous and pulmonary sections of CVS.
   Discussion: The interaction model of the Fontan circulation with VAD
   support demonstrates the normalization of the pressure and volume
   distribution in the CVS. This indicates that the method studied in this
   work may be a way to optimize the health condition of patients after
   Fontan procedure.
   Objectives: Autologous pericardium is one of the most ideal materials
   for cardiovascular reconstruction including pulmonary arteries and
   valvular cusps especially in pediatric patients. To improve the surgical
   handling, chemical pretreatments such as dehydration by ethanol (ET) or
   crosslinking by glutaraldehyde (GA) have been commonly attempted. In
   this study, we compared the effects of such chemical treatments with
   short period (10 min) on the mechanical properties of the porcine
   pericardium. Methods: Porcine pericardium (n=3) was separated into 3
   groups, raw group with no treatments (RAW), that under dehydration with
   70\% ET for10 min (ET) and crosslinking with 0.6\% GA for 10 min (GA).
   We measured 5 parameters of mechanical properties: the burst pressure,
   suture retention strength, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), ultimate
   strain (\%) and stimulus modulus. Results: Minimal burst pressure of RAW
   group, ET group and GA group were 12160 mmHg, 10640 mmHg, and 8360 mmHg,
   respectively, all of which were high enough for cardiovascular
   substitutes. There were no significant differences in suture retention
   strength (RAW: 3.242 +/- 0.261 N, ET: 3.298 +/- 0.214 N, GA: 2.985 +/-
   0.165 N, p=0.529), UTS (RAW: 18.238 +/- 1.987 MPa, ET: 19.104 +/- 2.234
   MPa, GA: 16.059 +/- 1.233 MPa, p=0.486) or Young's modulus (RAW: 4.964
   +/- 0.551 MPa, ET: 4.544 +/- 0.719 MPa, GA: 3.921 +/- 0.288 MPa,
   p=0.408). Only the ultimate strain of GA group was significantly higher
   between the 3 groups (RAW: 35.64 +/- 2.82 \%, ET: 37.99 +/- 2.38 \%, GA:
   46.39 +/- 3.96 \%, p=0.046). Discussion: Short period of chemical
   treatment using ET and GA might make it possible to improve the surgical
   handling without deteriorating the mechanical properties of pericardium.
   Engineering modelling and simulation have been being used in different
   industries for better product and process development for already many
   decades. Together with the developments in medical imaging, this
   engineering approach can now be applied to understand how different
   human organs function and eventually develop devices to replace them or
   support their correct functioning. A digital environment for development
   of artificial organs and medical devices is possible with correct
   application of engineering modelling and simulation. These concepts
   enable researchers and engineers to perform design iterations rapidly
   and with ease. This is why the application of engineering modelling and
   simulation is considered as one of the very important bio-technological
   advancements in the recent years and is projected to be so in the close
   future. In this respect; cardiology is one of the areas where this
   potential is being converted to valuable outputs. Virtual modelling and
   analysis of a representative beating human heart, patient specific heart
   modelling or digital prototypes of heart devices are main research
   interests of an interdisciplinary community of cardiologists, surgeons,
   engineers, and physicians. In the scope of cardiovascular simulations;
   patient specific (or normalized among a group of patients) medical
   imaging based CFD simulations and coupled multiphysics FSI simulations
   are the main approaches for generating the simulation frameworks moving
   forward in the road to ultimate digital twins of the human heart. This
   presentation is intended to give insights about various processes that
   lead to higher fidelity digital representations in the scope of
   cardiovascular simulations, including below:
   - CFD model generation based on CT scans - Non-invasive digital
   angiography \& FFR CT (Fractional Flow Reserve) - Post-TAVI coronary
   flow - Blood flow in SIMULIA LHHM (Living Heart Human Model) with
   mechanical valves - Transcatheter tissue engineered aortic valve FSI
   simulation - Evolut R stent deployment in LHHM - Mitral Valve and Mitral
   Clip FSI simulation The presentation intends to give a brief
   introduction on the simulation concepts/approaches which can be applied
   to cardiovascular problems. While it intends to encourage the community
   to take the advantage of these concepts in cardiovascular research, it
   highlights the importance of correct modelling and accurate numerical
   simulations.
   Objectives: The Berlin Heart EXCOR is the most commonly used ventricular
   assist device in children. Pump thrombosis is a major complication of
   the system and is most likely to occur in smaller pumps used for
   children under the age of 2. Pump exchange is seen as the therapeutic
   gold standard, but is associated with high mortality if in- or outflow
   cannulas are affected and therefor have to be changed surgically.
   Methods: Herein we report our experience in the use of tissue-type
   plasminogen activator (Alteplase, Actilyse (R)) for the therapy of an
   acute pump thrombosis subtotally occluding the inflow cannula of a 7
   month old girl supported by a Berlin Heart EXCOR LVAD. The infant was
   supported by LVAD therapy used for acute left ventricular failure due to
   fulminant myocarditis, and the system was implanted 20 days prior to
   when the thrombotic event was reported. A treatment protocol of 1.2mg/kg
   - initial bolus application of 0.12mg/kg/2mins - of Alteplase infusion
   given continuously for 120mins was used, and the assist device was
   connected to a Maquet Quadrox-I neonatal and pediatric oxygenator to
   obviate thrombembolic complications. Results: The infant supported by
   Berlin Heart EXCOR LVAD was haemodynamically stable prior to the
   thrombotic event, and anticoagulation was performed with a continuous
   heparin infusion. Within a couple of hours, she became tachycardic and
   developed signs of low cardiac output, and a subtotal occlusion of the
   inflow cannula of the Berlin Heart System was diagnosed. As surgery was
   felt to be highly problematic, we decided to infuse Alteplase and
   achieved short-term success with resolution of the pump thrombosis
   within 2 hours. There was no adverse event. Discussion: Tissue-type
   plasminogen activator thrombolysis might be an effective treatment for
   Berlin Heart EXCOR thrombosis in haemodynamically compromised children.
   Additionally, the use of a Maquet Quadrox-I oxygenator might minimize
   the risk of major complications (i.e. thromboembolism) that have been
   reported in the literature.
   Drug discovery and development to date has relied on animal models,
   which are useful, but fail to resemble human physiology. The discovery
   of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) has led to the emergence
   of a new paradigm of drug screening using human patient- and
   disease-specific organ/tissue-models. One promising approach to generate
   these models is by combining the hiPSC technology with microfluidic
   devices tailored to create microphysiological environments. Such
   organ-on-a-chip platforms (OoCs) or microphysiological systems combine
   human genetic background, in vivo-like tissue structure, physiological
   functionality, and ``vasculature-like{''} perfusion. Using
   microfabrication techniques, we have developed a variety of OoCs that
   incorporate complex human 3D tissues, such as retinal, choroidal,
   cardiac, pancreatic, and adipose tissue. By generating
   microphysiological environments the platform is capable of keeping the
   tissues viable and functional over multiple weeks. The OoCs generally
   consist of three functional components: organ-specific tissue chambers
   mimicking in vivo structure and microenvironment of the respective
   tissues; ``vasculature-like{''} media channels enabling a precise and
   computationally predictable delivery of soluble compounds (nutrients,
   drugs, hormones); ``endothelial-like{''} barriers protecting the tissues
   from shear forces while allowing diffusive transport. The small scale
   and accessibility for in situ analysis makes our OoCs amenable for both
   massive parallelization and integration into a high-content-screening
   approach. To facilitate and enable the adoption of OoCs in industrial
   and non-specialized laboratories, we have developed technologies for
   automated 3D tissue generation and for the flexible plug\&play
   connection of individual modules to multi-organ-chips. These
   technologies paired with the versatility of our OoCs pave the way for
   applications in drug development, personalized medicine, toxicity
   screening, and mechanistic research.
   Objectives: The HeartMate 3 (HM3; Abbott, USA) is a new compact LVAD
   which is associated with several new technical features (e.g. fully
   magnetically levitated pump, artificial pulse, large pump gaps, modular
   driveline, etc.). These benefits are supposed to lead to superior
   outcomes and reduced adverse events as compared to its predecessor
   HeartMate II (HMII; Abbott, USA) and other comparable assist devices.
   With this study, we investigated the effect of HM3 implantation on the
   occurrence of gastrointestinal (GI) bleedings compared to other LVADs.
   Methods: We retrospectively studied a patient cohort of 595 patients who
   were supported with left ventricular assist devices. 170 Patients were
   supported by HMII, 81 Patients were supported by HM3 and 344 Patients
   were supported by HVAD (HeartWare, Medtronic, USA). Data was determined
   through retrospective examination of medical records. Exclusion criteria
   were biventricular assist devices and other types of assist devices as
   well as LVAD exchange and re-operative procedures. Results: Out of 595
   patients 146 patients (24.4\%) presented with gastrointestinal bleeding
   after LVAD implantation. In the multivariate analysis GI bleeding was
   significantly dependent on age but not on the BMI or gender of the
   patient. Statistically we were able to show that the occurrence of GI
   bleedings is significantly connected to general bleedings but not to
   cerebral hemorrhages. The subgroup analysis revealed that the occurrence
   of GI bleedings was higher in the HVAD (26\%) and HMII (26\%) groups
   compared to the HM3 patients (14\%). However, statistical significance
   could not be achieved. Discussion: The novel HeartMate 3 shows a
   promising adverse event profile with a reduced rate of gastrointestinal
   bleedings compared to its competitors. However statistical significance
   could not be achieved in this study. Thus, larger multi-center cohort
   analyses are needed.
   Objectives: In medical practice, it is necessary to control the
   movements of various parts of the body: limbs, joints, chest, tumors,
   etc. For such purposes, the most suitable are the composite
   bionanomaterials in the composition of carbon nanotubes. We investigated
   the strain sensor (tensoresistor) based on the layers of the
   bionanomaterial contained biological material (bovine serum albumin, BSA
   - matrix) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT - filler). Methods:
   The aqueous dispersion of 25 wt.\% BSA/0.3 wt.\% MWCNT was applied by
   screen printing on flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrates. After
   drying layers by laser irradiation ( 970 nm) various parameters of
   layers were controlled, i.e. resistance R, bending angle q, number of
   cycles n, measurement time, etc. One measurement cycle corresponded to a
   change within the range q >>+/- 150 degrees. Results: The slopes of Sq =
   (1/R0)dR/dq of the R(q) curves were considered to be
   strain-sensitivities, where R0 is the resistance of the sensor with q=0.
   It was found that with increasing the number n, R and Sq increase and
   the hysteresis on R(q) decreases. For the tensoresistor obtained:
   specific resistances 0.1 divided by 1 Wxm, Sq1.0 divided by 1.5\%/grad.
   These results are high. Discussion: The physical picture of the change
   in the R(q) is as follows. When q>0, compression occurs, the amount of
   contacts between the nanotubes increases and the resistance drops
   relative to the state q=0. When q<0, the nanotubes move away from each
   other, the amount of contacts between the nanotubes decreases and the
   resistance increases relative to the state q=0. The examined layers of
   the bionanomaterial BSA/MWCNT as a strain sensor is of a particular
   interest for medical practice. In particular, for monitoring: movements
   (arms, blinking) and detection of signs of pathology (respiratory
   diseases, angina, et. al.).
   The new European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) is applicable on 26th
   May 2020. Then the current Medical Device Directive(MDD) and its
   national transpositions like the current German Medical Device Act
   (Medizinproduktegesetz) will be replaced by the new rules. Further
   transitions periods for existing certificates will not help for devices
   of the lowest risk class and will not free parties from taking into
   consideration the new rules for handling of device problems or
   registration. The new certification of existing devices in time will be
   challenging, because the accreditation and notification of notified
   bodies in accordance with the new requirements, which are needed for
   certification of higher risk class medical devices, is ongoing very
   slowly. The new European database is still not gone live, but the device
   and economic operator registration is dependent on the functioning of
   that database. A strong focus of the new regulation is on clinical
   evaluation of medical devices, which will leave manufacturers and
   developers probably with open questions. For example, what extend of
   clinical data is sufficient for keeping an existing device on the
   market? The presentation will highlight several obvious or less obvious
   changes due to the new regulation. It will provide guidance where to
   find additional answers for specific questions. And it will give an
   outlook on upcoming additional legislation and guidance.
   Objectives: Exercise capacity in patients with a continuous-flow left
   ventricular assist device (LVAD) is 50\% compared to healthy subjects.
   Some patients show a better performance than others. Aim of this work is
   to investigate the factors responsible of this inter-subject
   variability. Methods: A cardiorespiratory simulator (CRS) was developed
   and combined with a model of the HVAD running at 2700 rpm to reproduce
   an ``average{''} LVAD patients hemodynamic at rest and at exercise. The
   CRS was validated using the average hemodynamic data of >200 LVAD
   patients from the literature. Starting from this ``average{''} LVAD
   profile, a sensitivity analysis was conducted by simulating a left/right
   ventricular contractility (Elmax/Ermax) and heat rate (HR) 20\% higher
   than value usually observed at exercise. Results: The simulated
   ``average{''} LVAD profile at rest is in full support with a total
   cardiac output (CO) of 4.8 l/min and a wedge pressure (Pw) of 13 mmHg.
   At exercise Pw increases to 26 mmHg and CO increases to 6.8 l/min, of
   which 5.3 l/min pumped by the LVAD (QLVAD) and 1.5 l/min by the
   ventricle (QLV). An increased Elmax at exercise assures lower Pw (22
   mmHg) and higher CO (7.4 l/min) due to a better contribution of the
   ventricle (QVAD=4.7 l/min, QLV=2.7 l/min). An improved HR also helps to
   sustain a better CO (7.1 l/min) as a combined effect of both pumps
   (QVAD= 5.4 l/min, QLV=1.7 l/min). A better Emaxr induces a smaller
   improvement in CO (7.0 l/min) due to the increased LVAD support
   (QVAD=5.5 l/min, QLV=1.5 l/min), however Pw reaches 31 mmHg. Discussion:
   A better left ventricular inotropic response is mostly effective in
   accommodating a higher CO at exercise. A better right ventricular
   function has mild effects on CO and can increase Pw if not sustained by
   a good ejection on the left side. These results should be taken into
   account for the design of a physiological LVAD speed controller,
   tailored on specific patient's needs.
   The electro-hydraulically actuated Carmat total artificial heart (C-TAH)
   is designed for biventricular replacement in patients suffering from
   end-stage heart failure, either as bridge to transplant or destination
   therapy. It generates pulsatile flow which is automatically adapted to
   the patient's physiological needs. The device contains bio-prosthetic
   blood contacting materials, allowing for low dose anti-coagulation. A
   multi-centre European study is currently underway to assess the safety
   and performance of the C-TAH, with 6-months survival as primary
   objective. Preliminary results will be presented from a cohort of 10
   patients included in the study.
   Objectives: The mechano-biological behavior of mesenchymal stem cells
   (MSCs) in 2D and 3D cultures is determined by formation of actin
   filaments which occur as branched stress fibers. For clinical-scale
   expansion of functional MSCs, the use of xeno-based serum products is
   prohibited, but human platelet lysate (HPL) can potentially replace
   fetal bovine serum. Here we investigate actin filament formation and
   mitochondrial morphology in the 2D and 3D MSC culture supplemented with
   HPL and analyzed immunomodulatory molecules GARP, Foxp3 and IDO
   following pro-inflammatory stimulation. Methods: Human platelet lysate
   composition was determined with a proteome profiler assay. Amnion
   derived MSCs were cultured in HPL supplemented media and MSC morphology
   was analyzed by flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and scanning
   electron microscopy. Mechano-biological properties of cultured MSCs were
   performed by atomic force microscopy. Results: The occurrence of actin
   filaments in 2D MSCs cultivated in HPL supplemented media was decreased
   as compared to conventional growth media, where the number of ventral
   stress fibers, anchored at each end by focal adhesions, was affected and
   influenced membrane elasticity. Dorsal stress fibers or transverse arcs
   were not affected. Mitochondrial network dynamics in HPL cultivated MSCs
   showed a perinuclear accumulation. 3D cultivation of MSCs was less
   sensitive to media supplementation. Functional activity of GARP was
   found non-stimulated MSCs while expression of Foxp3 and IDO relied on
   pro-inflammatory stimuli. Discussion: In conclusion we can say that
   mechano-biological capabilities of MSCs cultivated in 2D and 3D rely on
   stress fibers, mitochondrial distribution and certain bioactive
   molecules such as GARP, Foxp3 and IDO. HPL supplementation leads to
   downregulation of f-actin filament formation as well as conserved
   membrane elasticity.
   Objectives: Modern research in cryobiology requires a deeper
   understanding of the influence of different factors on the
   cryopreservation of cells, tissues, and organs. One of these factors is
   ice crystallization which has a tremendous impact on the surveillance
   and quality of live objects during freezing, long term storage, and
   thawing. Analysis of this process requires software which should be able
   to obtain quantitative parameters of crystals in a human-like manner
   with acceptable processing speed. The purpose of this work is to
   consider the possibility of using the multiscale image representation
   for the quantitative analysis of ice crystals. Methods: In our research,
   we used microscopic images of ice crystals during crystals formation and
   thawing. In previous studies for the segmentation of ice crystals on the
   image, we used different approaches such as active contour. At the same
   time, it should be noticed that the speed of active contour expansion is
   low and thus time-consuming to process large time sequence. Thus, we
   suggest the application of a Gaussian Pyramid. This multiscale
   representation allows analysis at a low scale and improves at a high
   scale. Results: We have analyzed multiple images using the proposed
   approach. The results in the first approximation show a 2-fold increase
   in speed when using our implementation of active contours. At the same
   time, the segmented areas of crystals correspond to the approach without
   the use of multi-scale image representation. Discussion: The results of
   this work show that multiscale image representation can be applied to
   improve the speed and applicability of modern software for automated
   image analysis. The next steps will include applicability evaluation of
   multiscale representation for different cases as well as the development
   of software realizing vector processor architecture.
   Objectives: One of the objectives of hemodialysis (HD) is preserving
   optimal acid-base homeostasis. Bicarbonate is an obligatory component of
   dialysis fluids in order to titrate the acidic products of protein
   metabolism that accumulate between treatments. Even though bicarbonate
   can easily transfer across HD membranes, its plasma concentration does
   not equilibrate with that in dialysis fluid by the end of the treatment,
   for reasons unclear. We used a mathematical model to test whether an
   intradialytic increase in total non-bicarbonate buffer concentration in
   plasma (tNBBp) could explain this lack of equilibrium. Methods: We
   modified the model of CO2 and bicarbonate whole body transport proposed
   in 1995 by Rees and Andreassen, adding bicarbonate transfer from
   dialysis fluid to plasma via a dialyzer connected to an arteriovenous
   fistula. The model described the transport of O2, CO2, and base excess
   between different compartments: arterial and venous circulations,
   interstitial fluid and lung capillaries. In each compartment, equations
   describing the biochemistry of blood were solved to estimate the
   components of bicarbonate and non-bicarbonate buffer systems. Results:
   The model qualitatively described the typical intradialytic pattern of
   bicarbonate concentration, pH, base excess, CO2 and O2 partial pressures
   observed in patients under routine thrice weekly HD. Model predictions
   were compared assuming a constant or increasing tNBBp during HD. When
   tNBBp was allowed to increase, the intradialytic increase in plasma
   bicarbonate concentration was blunted and the model predictions better
   fit published time-dependent intradialytic plasma bicarbonate
   concentrations. Discussion: It was suggested in literature that HD
   treatment may stimulate an increased concentration of non-bicarbonate
   buffers and release of hydrogen ions from these organic acids. Our
   preliminary modeling results are consistent with this hypothesis and
   show that the model is capable of predicting the effect of the HD
   treatment on the buffer systems of the body.
   Objectives: To develop an implant for the bone-tendon transition, it is
   our approach to optimize polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds by coating for
   a functionalization with drug release systems. The procedure during the
   functionalization should enable a release of growth factors in a
   spatially and temporally graded way. Methods: The PCL fiber mats were
   prepared by electrospinning. Polydopamine (pDA)-based coatings were used
   to modify the surface of the fibers. To get thin polymeric, hydrophilic
   and biocompatible coatings we applied the pure pDA system and a
   co-deposition with amines (ethylenediamine (ED), hexamethylenediamine
   (HMD) and polyethyleneimine (PEI)). To functionalize our system with
   growth factors we used chitosan-based nanoparticles which can be loaded
   with the therapeutic proteins BMP-2 and TGF-beta. By a defined dipping
   procedure we generate fiber mats with a graded functionalization.
   Results: The measurement of the contact angle and the surface zeta
   potential showed a change from a hydrophobic PCL surface to a highly
   hydrophilic and amphoteric character for the coated systems. The charged
   surface enables the further functionalization with loaded nanoparticles.
   The release of BMP2 and TGF-beta from the functionalized scaffolds was
   established. With a dipping procedure we are able to functionalize our
   scaffolds in a graded way. Confocal laser scanning microscopy with
   fluorescence-labeled NP showed that we could generate up to three
   differently functionalized regions. Discussion: The results show the
   methodology is suited to prepare implants, which can release growth
   factors in a spatially and temporally controlled way. These graded
   implants can be used for in-situ tissue engineering.
   Objectives: Solute movement from blood to dialysis solution is largely
   determined by transmembrane pressure (TMP). Accordingly, it was
   imperative to develop a TMP control system that allows for the
   maintanence of constant pressure. TMP in dialyzer is one of the tasks in
   wearable artificial kidney development. In most of the known devices,
   transmembrane pressure is regulated only by adjusting the flow-pressure
   characteristics of the pump or mechanical uncontrolled clamping line.
   Methods: A system was proposed which consists of a pinch valve, a DC
   motor and a control circuit. This device allows you to automatically
   adjust the pressure. At first, the device reads data from the
   differential sensor, which measures the TMP. After that, the position of
   the moving part of the pinch valve changes and the degree of clamping of
   the line changes, which in turn affects the value of TMP. The case of
   the device was made using a 3D printer. A test bench was created in
   order to determine the effectiveness of maintaining a constant TMP. It
   consists of five parts: two circuits with two peristaltic pumps, a
   dialyzer, a differential pressure sensor and a power source. The
   pressure from the primary circuit was varied by manually clamping the
   line and the degree of pressure differential compensation by the pinch
   valve was determined. Results: The experiment showed that the TMP
   changes are fully compensated by the pinch valve. Accuracy of the
   developed device depends largely on accuracy of pressure measurement
   sensor. There was no change in the flow rate of the fluid, and this is
   important, because the rate of dialysate regeneration depends on the
   flow rate of the fluid. Discussion: The experiment showed that this
   device can be used to control TMP. Accuracy of the system allows you to
   use it in the wearable artificial kidney.
   Objectives: This paper describes the testing methods used in the
   development of software for an implantable heart monitor. It is a
   complex medical system. To identify errors made while writing software,
   as well as to detect deviations in the operation of the device in a
   timely manner, it is necessary to constantly carry out testing of all
   elements of the system. Methods: Testing methods used in the development
   of an implantable heart monitor: - debugging using JTAG, - self-test
   system, - testing via COM port, - recording test information in the
   device's internal memory (data logging), - interprocessor testing.
   Consider some of them in more detail. Debugging and testing using JTAG:
   Due to the fact that the development was carried out in Code Composer
   environment, this allowed the use of a special script language GEL
   (General Extension Language). This is an expression language used by the
   CCS debugger. Launch GEL files are used to automate software
   development. GEL is an interpreted language, and its syntax is the same
   as C. Thereby it is possible to carry out tests, and change them, or add
   new ones in the process of the main software. Logging: One of the
   testing methods is to track changes in the state of the system over
   time. One way is to write data to the device's internal memory. But in
   such a way that you can track at what point in time the change occurred.
   For this you can use time stamps. If the data is recorded strictly with
   a certain frequency, you can do without time stamps. Results: The
   presented test methods differ in that some of them can be used only in
   the early stages of development and some even when the device is at the
   end user. Discussion: Cardiovascular diseases are very dangerous and
   difficult to diagnose. Early diagnosis and prediction of these diseases
   can lead to an improvement in the quality of life of patients.
   Objectives: To clarify the reasons, beneficial effects and duration of
   AVF patency after radiological interventions in AVF stenosis. Methods:
   In 174 patients, 522 radiological investigations and endovascular
   treatments such as percutaneous trans luminal angioplasty (PTA) were
   analyzed, retrospectively. All investigations were performed due to
   clinical suspicion of impaired AVF function. Results: Arterial stenosis
   was significantly more frequent among patients with diabetes mellitus (p
   < 0.001) and interstitial nephritis (p < 0.001). According to the venous
   stenosis, the diagnosis did not affect the frequency (p=0.22), neither
   the degree of the stenosis (p=0.39). The degree of stenosis prior to PTA
   correlated significantly with the degree of remaining stenosis after
   intervention (p<0.001). Of the 174 patients, 123 (71\%) performed a
   total of 318 PTA investigations. Repeated PTA was performed
   significantly more often in patients with diabetic nephropathy. The
   median times to first PTA and to the subsequent PTAs were 9.5 months and
   5 months, respectively. Discussion: Patients with diabetic nephropathy
   are at a greater risk of getting recurrent stenosis; this motivates a
   closer follow up for these patients. Clinically significant stenosis
   should be dilated as meticulously and as soon as possible. Occlusions of
   the AVF in most instances can be successfully thrombolyzed or dilated
   upon early diagnosis.
   Objectives: Designing new ventricular assist devices to coupe two major
   challenges in the field: less invasive intervention and reducing side
   effects was our objective. Methods: Computer-aided design and
   computational fluid dynamics were performed with Solidworks 2017 to
   design and test several new bearingless centrifugal ventricular assist
   devices. Fused deposition modeling was used to build the models and
   subcutaneous implantation was simulated and transcutaneous power
   transfer was tested. Results: Two bearingless, fully implantable
   ventricular assisted devices were developed. The first is a radial flux
   motor fully magnetically levitated ventricular assist device. The second
   is an axial flux hydro-magnetically suspended rotor ventricular assist
   device. Both devices contain an internal rechargeable battery, power
   transfer coil, electronic circuit and have a cylindrical shape with
   15-20 mm height and 100 mm diameter. The flow is 3 l/min at 135 mmHg is
   achieved and efficiency of power transfer of 80\% with a 5 mm gap. The
   devices are implantable in a pectoral subcutaneous pocket with the
   inflow connected to left atrium and the outflow to subclavian artery in
   a fashion pioneered in this field by CircuLite Synergy. Discussion: Both
   devices came with innovations in motor and pump design that set the
   foundation to build the entire system in a single body low height
   cylindrical shape, optimal for subcutaneous implantation and by this
   with good transcutaneous power transfer efficiency.
   Objectives: For most in vitro cultivations of mammalian cells, culture
   medium is supplemented with serum, which contains important proteins and
   factors for the cell growth. Previous experiments showed already a
   positive effect of human platelet lysate (hPL) as a medium supplement
   for the two-dimensional (2D) cultivation of mesenchymal stem cells
   (MSC). Since 3D culture systems gain big interest for in vitro
   applications and regenerative medicine, the influence of hPL on 3D cell
   culture models must also be investigated. Semi synthetic protein not
   sign based hydrogels represent a very promising 3D cell culture
   platform, which is biocompatible and biodegradable. Methods: In our
   work, gelatine-methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels with a various degree of
   functionalization were dissolved in different hPL concentrations (0 \%,
   2.5 \%, 50 \%, 100 \% hPL). The Influence of hPL on proliferation and
   differentiation of in GelMa encapsulated MSCs were monitored and
   measured via viability assays, immunocytochemical stainings and
   microscopy. Furthermore, the influence of hPL addition on mechanical
   characteristics of GelMA hydrogels was examined by swelling studies and
   rheometric analysis. Results: The addition of hPL to GelMA hydrogels
   enhances the cell-spreading, the degree of differentiation as well as
   cell viability in concentration-depended manner. Besides, the results of
   the rheometric tests showed an increase of hydrogel stiffness by using
   higher concentrations of hPL. Discussion: Obtained results demonstrate
   that supplementation of hydrogels with hPL has a positive effect on cell
   growth and differentiation. Moreover, hPL can be a promising hydrogel
   stiffness enhancer for application in 3D bioprinting.
   Objectives: Generally, LVAD thrombosis is diagnosed only by reviewing
   online logfiles that show an increase of power consumption and flow of
   the device. In order to increase diagnostic power and improve treatment
   management, trans-thoracic echocardiography was carried out to assess
   any blood flow changes. Methods: Eight patients (M 7; F 1) experienced a
   total of 17 Heart Ware VAD thromboses. At echocardiogram, a 4-chamber
   view was obtained and the echo probe beam was aligned to blood flow of
   the inflow cannula. Continous-wave Doppler was applied for the
   assessment of: 1) the increase of flow maximal velocity (Vmax) above
   basal ranges over several cardiac cycles and 2) the irregular
   discontinous sound of the device. Online logfiles were reviewed for
   abnormal increase in power consumption and flow compared to basal data.
   All patients underwent thrombolysis with rTPA. Echocardiography results
   before and after treatment were compared. Results: Thrombolysis was
   successful in all patients; one patient died due to cerebral
   haemorrhage. Echocardiograms before thrombolysis showed an increased
   mean Vmax of 6.4 +/- 0.5 m/sec, whereas after treatment Vmax was 360 +/-
   0.2 m/sec (p < 0.001). In all cases irregular, abnormal and
   discontinuous sounds were heard in thrombosed inflow cannulae. After
   thrombolysis only washing jet sounds were heard. Before thrombolysis
   logfiles showed a mean increase of power consumption of 5.6 +/- 0.3
   watts, returning to basal values of 3.8 +/- 0.3 watts after thrombolysis
   (p<0.001). Before thrombolysis logfiles showed mean flow of 6.2 +/- 0.6
   L/min, after treatment mean flow was back to normal ranges 4.2 +/- 0.5
   L/sec (p<0.001). Discussion: Transthoracic echocardiography showed a
   significant increase of blood flows in the inflow cannula of thrombosed
   LVAD devices, confirming findings of log files review. A combined
   approach by logfiles review and echocardiography is recommended in
   patients with LVAD thrombosis.
   Objectives: Leukocyte activation is correlated to a reduced immune
   response in ventricular assist device (VAD) patients. Research has
   displayed leukocyte microparticle (MP; 200-1000nm diameter) increases
   following VAD shear stress. However, questions still arise regarding MP
   role, impact and biogenesis. MPs are plasma membrane derived, but there
   are smaller (50-100nm diameter), cytoplasmic vesicles (exosomes) which
   are often overlooked, or mistaken for MPs. As such, unless these
   vesicles are successfully separated, they should be categorised as
   extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are known to have roles in cellular
   communications and implications in diseases, and it is desirable to
   assess leukocyte sub-sets and any associated roles in VAD complications.
   Methods: Bovine blood was diluted to a haematocrit of 30 +/- 2\%
   according to ASTM standards. Blood was pumped for 6 hours in vitro with
   the CentriMag (R) centrifugal pump (Thoratec (R) Corp., USA). Flow
   cytometry determined a leukocyte EV population, having eliminated
   cellular debris. Platelet-poor plasma was tested for vesicle size and
   quantity using Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), and immunoblotting
   conducted for exosome markers. Results: Flow cytometry data displayed an
   increase in leukocyte death in the CentriMag, correlating to an increase
   in leukocyte derived EV production. Further analysis determined that
   these vesicles were mainly monocyte derived, suggesting a potential
   implication in inflammation. Preliminary NTA and immunoblotting
   displayed increased EVs following shear, namely exosomes. Discussion:
   The presence of exosome marker staining and NTA size analysis displays
   evidence in favour of vesicle increase not being MP specific. As EVs
   have known implications in inflammation, infection and disease, these
   results suggest that exosomes may be associated with adverse events in
   clinical settings. Thus, exosomes should be further examined to
   elucidate any role as biomarkers of VAD related complications.
   Objectives: To investigate the influence of bone turnover markers in
   end-stage renal disease patients for severe secondary
   hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). Methods: 221 ESRD patients with SHPT were
   split into two groups according to the iPTH level: Mild SHPT group
   (M-group) (iPTH130 -600 pg/ml, n=86) and severe SHPT group (S-group)
   (iPTH > 1500pg/ml, n=53). Serum BTM such as beta- CrossLaps (ss-CTX)
   procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), osteocalcin (OC) were
   detected. Results: Compared to the M-group, the patients in S-group had
   higher levels of the ss-CTX (5877.40 +/- 423.01 pg/ml, vs 3206.90 +/-
   1438.27), P=0.000, the P1NP (1145.50 +/- 171.36 ug /ml, vs 440.00 +/-
   308.12), P=0.000, the OC (258.52 +/- 48.61 ng/ml, vs 221.74 +/- 75.99
   ng/ml), P=0.000. ROC Curve analysis for the main risk factors of the
   parathyroid hyperplasia were ss-CTX, P1NP, sALP, iPTH. Discussion:
   Severe SHPT had higher levels of bone turnover markers, which may have
   aggravated CKD-MBD.
   Objectives: One of the main functions of renal replacement therapy is
   removal of excess products of metabolism from blood. Uremic toxins,
   waste products found in the blood of patients in need of renal
   replacement therapy (RRT), have very high blood concentrations and are
   harmful to the organism. Uremic toxins have been found over 100 and
   their classification is based on their molecular mass and linkage to
   proteins. EUTox, the European uremic toxin work group, has divided
   uremic toxins into 3 groups: water soluble toxins with small molecular
   mass (MM) < 500 Da (e.g. urea); middle size molecules, MM > 500 Da,
   (e.g. beta 2-microglobulin); protein-bound uremic toxins (e.g. indoxyl
   sulphate and rho-cresyl sulfate). Methods: TalTech and a spin-off
   company grown out of the university, OFT, have developed a new,
   real-time multicomponent (MCM)-sensor to monitor all uremic toxin groups
   in RRT. MCM-sensor contains miniature LED-technology to measure
   UV-absorbance and fluorescence. During online measurements, the sensor
   is connected to dialysis machine outlet with easy-to-handle connectors.
   Results: The results from a pilot clinical study at Nephrology
   Department of North Estonia Medical Centre and Nephrology Department of
   Linkoping University Hospital will be presented. The outputs of the
   sensor are on-line concentration patterns of small, middle and
   protein-bound uremic toxins in the waste dialysis and the clinical
   parameters of the uremic toxin removal (removal rate, total solute
   removal). A telemetry application enables to follow the dialytic removal
   even on remote distances. Discussion: A concept for smart real-time
   monitoring of intermittent RRT has been realized as a novel miniaturized
   optical sensor performing intradialytic on-line multicomponent uremic
   toxins monitoring in the spent dialysate.
   Objectives: Since Carbon Nanotubes (CNT) were shown to enhance neural
   outgrowth towards them, an approach with a CNT-Silicone rubber compound
   that immerses the CNTs and thus anchors them to the implant is
   investigated in an animal model Methods: To compare the CNT-silicone
   rubber to state-of-the-art neuronal implant materials, 6 variations of
   the same implant with varying exposed materials were fabricated. The
   thin-film implants consisted of a polyimide substrate and metal pathways
   encapsulated in silicone rubber. Depending on the batch, either metal or
   CNT-silicone rubber were exposed. Female mice were implanted on the
   brain and under the skin (flank area) for 60 or 180 days. After
   necropsy, the head was fixed in 4\% neutral buffered formaldehyde. After
   24h, it was stored in 70\% ethanol for another 24h and then decalcified.
   It was then trimmed, dehydrated in ascending alcohol series and xylene.
   After embedding in Technovit 8100, sections with nominal thickness of 2
   mu m were cut. The same procedure was performed on the implants and skin
   from the flank, except they were embedded in paraffin and cut into 3 mu
   m slices. Light microscopic examination of Hematoxylin and eosin stained
   slices was performed. Results: During histopathological examination,
   both findings associated with surgery and implant-related microscopic
   changes were observed in sections from the head and flank. The tissue
   around the implant showed similar reactions in all groups. Macrophages
   and inflammatory cells as well as slight fibrosis were found around the
   implant in all animals Discussion: Preparation of tissue sections
   including thin film implants was shown to be possible, yet the
   differences in material properties led to problems during cutting.
   However, usage of different embedding materials for the tissues worked.
   These first results suggest that the used CNT-Silicone rubber materials
   could be used in short term applications.
   Objectives: The properties of nanocomposite (NC) poly
   (N-isopropylacrylamide) (NIPAM) hydrogels as well as 3D printing
   techniques for hydrogels have gained a lot of significance in the tissue
   engineering community. This study aims at the development of a stable
   water based ink formulation for nanocomposite hydrogels usable by
   DLP/SLA 3D-printers in the range of 365 - 405 nm to use them e.g. for
   investigations in water flows. Methods: Diphenyl
   (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide (as photo-initiator), Laponite
   XLG (as nanocomposite crosslinker), sodium dodecyl sulfate (as
   surfactant) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (as crystallization inhibitor) were
   dissolved in a N-butyl acetat and isopropanol solution at room
   temperature. This organic phase was then mixed with bi-distilled water
   and stirred for 20 minutes in a closed container to form a micro
   emulsion. The micro emulsion was flash freezed in liquid nitrogen and
   freeze dried in a Virtis Advantage Plus freeze drying unit for at least
   24 h at -50 degrees C and 0.4 mbar. The obtained powder could be
   dispersed in a NIPAM/water solution to form a stable, UV-curable ink. To
   show the applicability of hydrogels for investigating flows around
   bodies in principle, experiments in a water channel will be conducted.
   Results: The obtained ink is suitable for the most commonly used SLA and
   DLP printers in the range of 365 - 405 nm. Whereas the expected curing
   time is much higher than the curing time of commercially available
   standard polymeric printing inks due to the inhibiting effect of the
   Laponite XLG. The applicability experiments are in preparation.
   Discussion: NC-hydrogels obtain through this photo-polymerization method
   show similar mechanical properties to the standard NC-hydrogels obtained
   through radical polymerization with potassium peroxodisulfate.
   Objectives: Laser interference lithography (LIL) and the layer-by-layer
   (LbL) technique are combined here for the first time to design a system
   with variable nanotopographies and surface viscoelasticity to regulate
   cell behavior. Methods: LIL is used to generate hexagonally arranged
   nanostructures of gold with different periodicity. In contrast, LBL is
   used to assemble a multilayer system of poly-L-lysine (PLL) and
   hyaluronic acid (HA) on top of the nanostructures. Moreover, the
   viscoelastic properties of that system are controlled by chemical
   cross-linking. Results: We show that the topography designed with LIL is
   still present after multilayer deposition and that the formation of the
   multilayer system renders the surfaces hydrophilic, which is opposite to
   the hydrophobic nature of pristine nanostructures. The heterogenic
   system is applied to study the effect on adhesion and differentiation of
   human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSC). We show that hADSC spreading
   is increasing with cross-linking degree on flat multilayers, while it is
   decreasing on nanostructures modified with multilayers. In addition,
   early effects on signal transduction processes are seen. Finally, hADSC
   differentiation into chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages is superior to
   adipogenic lineages on nanostructures modified with multilayers.
   Discussion: Hence, the presented system offers great potential to guide
   stem cell differentiation on surfaces of implants and tissue engineering
   scaffolds.
   Objectives: The Gibbs-Donnan theory describes the equilibrium of ionic
   solutions separated by a semipermeable membrane, when only one solution
   contains charged macromolecules that cannot pass the membrane. The
   problem was originally formulated for simple solutions, such as
   dissociated NaCl, which allowed to calculate the ratio between ions
   concentrations at the sides of the membrane (Gibbs-Donnan factor).
   Solutions like plasma and interstitial fluid, and dialysate, contain
   however ions with different valence, and proteins in each compartment
   have a different concentration (and therefore charge); the classic
   theory needs an extension to describe these real-world scenarios. In
   this study we propose a new method to calculate Gibbs-Donnan factors for
   such more complex cases. Methods: From electroneutrality considerations
   and the definition of Nernst potential it is possible to derive a new
   expression of Gibbs-Donnan factor which depends on the total
   concentrations of ions of the same valence. This allows, for two
   solutions A and B, to calculate the concentration of all ions in
   solution B, given: 1) macromolecule concentrations in A and B, 2)
   solutes concentrations in A. The transitivity of Donnan factors was
   proved: for 3 solutions at equilibrium (A, B, C) the factor of A to C is
   equal to the ratio of the factors from A to B and B to C. Results: As a
   demonstration, the theory was applied to the calculation of the
   concentrations in interstitial fluid (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, HCO3-,
   HPO42-, SO42-, C3H5O3-) starting from values reported in literature. The
   calculated interstitial concentrations were close to the reported ones,
   with a global RMSE equal to 6\%. Discussion: The Donnan factors for
   small ions in biological fluids have relatively small deviation from
   unity, but their precise value may be of importance for ions whose
   concentrations are similar at both sides of the membrane, as for example
   sodium and calcium transport in hemodialyzers and peritoneal dialysis.
   Objectives: Biobanking of in vitro engineered tissues presents obvious
   advantages associated with flexible preparation and shipping scheduling.
   To provide sufficient cryoprotection, alternative research models,
   freezing approaches and cryoprotective agents (CPAs) have to be
   established in view of complexity and diversity of composite tissues.
   Here, we evaluated the effects of conventional freezing (CF) and
   directional freezing (DF) for cryopreservation of cell-seeded
   electrospun fiber mats. Methods: Fiber mats were produced from
   polycaprolactone and polylactic acid (PCL-PLA, ratio 200:100) using
   electrospinning. Structure of electrospun mats was characterized using
   SEM and FTIR, whereas their heat capacity was determined using DSC. The
   square-shape mats (1x1 cm, UV-sterilized) were seeded with HeLa cells
   (5x104/scaffold) and cultivated at static conditions. Samples were
   frozen using 1 K/min to -80 degrees C (CF) or with the directional ice
   growth at the speed of 30 mu m/sec over a 2.6 mm gradient gap (from -4
   to -10 degrees C) i.e. 4 K/min followed by further cooling to -20
   degrees C at 1 K/min (translational cryostage) and to -80 degrees C with
   1 K/min (LN flow cooling stage). The viability of cells was evaluated 24
   h after thawing using fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide
   staining. Results: PCL-PLA mats exhibited no cytotoxicity on HeLa cells
   in vitro (viability higher than 90\%). Only single cells survived both
   CF and DF when frozen in culture medium (negative control). In contrast,
   the majority of cells on fiber mats were alive after freezing under
   protection of DMSO. Discussion: We showed that although not yet
   optimized, DF was as effective as CF for cryopreservation of cell-seeded
   PCL-PLA fiber mats. Preliminary studies on using antifreeze protein Type
   III (AFPIII) (10 and 100 mu M) as a sole CPA indicates that
   extracellular protection might not be enough to prevent freezing injury.
   Our recent work on electroporation of cells within electrospun fiber
   mats yielded encouraging results and the further initiative will be to
   deliver AFPs into cells using electroporation to provide DMSO-free
   cryopreservation of tissue-engineered constructs.
   Objectives: Computational tools for accurate evaluation of healthcare
   products are increasingly being recognized by the European Parliament,
   US Congress and FDA and represent a highly valuable tool for speeding up
   and reducing investments associated with the demanding certification
   process of medical devices. InSilicoTrials Technologies is developing a
   collaborative, automatized cloud-based platform to assist medical device
   and pharma companies in performing modelling and simulation activities
   to accelerate medical innovation while responding to recommendations of
   European and US parliaments and regulatory bodies. Methods: Simulations
   provided by scientific partners are integrated within a secured and
   privacy-preserved environment, ultimately providing the users
   (companies, research and clinical centers) with in silico solutions for
   different steps of the R\&D process on medical devices and drugs.
   Simulation results as well as an automatically created simulation report
   can be formatted in conformity with guidelines provided by EMA and FDA
   while taking in consideration the new European Medical Device
   Regulation. Results: Tools currently hosted on the platform are: NuMRIs,
   an automatic tool to assess magnetic resonance imaging radio-frequency
   safety of medical devices, implemented in collaboration with the US FDA
   Center for Devices and Radiological Health and ANSYS. QT/TdP Risk
   Screen, an automated tool to assess drug-induced pro-arrhythmic and
   Torsade de Pointes risk of small molecules, developed in collaboration
   with Universitat Politecnica de Valencia and Fundacio' Institut Mar
   d'Investigations Mediques. Discussion: The use of computational
   technologies to support med registration is limited in scope or absent
   while the agencies are promoting the use of M\&S in R\&D and
   registration. This causes a gap in know-how between reality of the
   industry and regulatory expectations. InSilicoTrials bridges these gaps
   and helps industries to conform to regulatory recommendations in a
   timely and cost-effective manner.
   Objectives: Dialyzer design enhancing internal filtration may be
   beneficial to remove middle molecules from the patient's blood for the
   treatment of renal pathologies. Mathematical models have been proposed
   to predict the rate of internal filtration, at varying dialyzer geometry
   and operating conditions. However, such models generally consist of
   difficult differential equations, that may not be easily used and
   implemented in clinical practice. In this work, an analytical model to
   predict internal filtration, at varying dialyzer geometry and operating
   conditions, is presented. Methods: To identify an analytical formula
   allowing for the prediction of internal filtration, the Poiseuille
   equation was used to describe axial momentum transport in the blood and
   dialysate compartment, assuming constant fluid viscosities, whereas
   radial momentum transport across the membrane was described with the
   Darcy equation, assuming linear ultrafiltration flux. The model was
   validated by comparing the pressure profiles in blood and dialysate
   compartments, and the rate of internal filtration predicted by the model
   with experimental data reported in literature for in-house Theranova 400
   dialyzer. Results: An analytical formula to predict the rate of internal
   filtration at varying dialyzer geometry and operating conditions was
   obtained. Very good agreement (i.e. percentage error lower than 2\%) was
   found between model predictions and experimental data for blood flow
   rate increasing from 300 to 400 ml/min, at constant dialyzer flow rate
   and zero net ultrafiltration flow rate. Good agreement was also found
   between internal filtration predicted by the analytical model presented
   in this work, and that predicted by using other one-dimensional
   mathematical models reported in literature. Discussion: The analytical
   model presented in this work agrees well with experimental data, and can
   be used predict the rate of internal filtration at varying dialyzer
   geometry and operating conditions.
   Objectives: Despite the growing acceptance of LVAD therapy, concerns
   relating to adverse events have been raised. Fields such as implantation
   techniques, patient management and patient selection pose opportunities
   to advance outcomes, however, new and enhanced device technology, such
   as the ReinVAD LVAD, will have to contribute to improve and grow the
   therapy. Methods: The ReinVAD GmbH was founded as spin-off company of
   the Helmholtz-Institute of the RWTH Aachen University, Germany, and
   leads the development project to regulatory approval and clinical
   application. The core technology is a miniaturized, 3(rd) generation,
   centrifugal blood pump. It is the result of a multidisciplinary research
   and development program equipping the system with features that will
   improve outcome for bridge to transplantation and especially destination
   therapy patients. Results: Chronic trials typically up to 90 days in a
   sheep confirm the capabilities of the system with excellent resistance
   to thrombogenicity since no design related thrombus could be found
   despite ceased anti-coagulation after 6 weeks. Implemented features are
   a pump for partial and full support with flow up to 10 l/min, a fully
   integrated flow sensor, an implantable driveline connector, a highly
   pressure-sensitive pump characteristic, an automated speed controller
   and a user-friendly one-piece extracorporeal system. The sensor provides
   real flow measurements. The driveline connector ensures easy exchange in
   case of infections and renders the system ready-for-TET. The pump
   pressure sensitivity, among other effects, leads to increased exercise
   capacity and arterial pulsation. The controller ensures that the pump
   always operates at its optimal speed. The one-piece extracorporeal
   system reduces use errors and improves satisfaction with this component
   of everyday life. Discussion: The results indicate that the ReinVAD LVAD
   will be an effective system to enhance long-term circulatory support
   therapy.
   Objectives: Cardiovascular diseases shorten life span of hemodialysis
   (HD) patients. Recently pentraxin 3 (PTX) was considered as a biomarker
   of cardiac function, as well as an inflammatory biomarker. The aim of
   this study was to investigate if PTX was a useful biomarker to estimate
   patients' cardiac condition more than as inflammatory biomarker by
   analysing plasma in PTX, CRP, NT-pro-BNP (Pro-BNP) and troponin T before
   and after HD. Methods: Twenty patients on chronic HD were studied in a
   prospective cross-over study with three modes of HD with polysulfone
   dialyzers: (a) dry-stored (F8HPS, Fresenius) with a low blood level in
   the venous chamber (DL), (b) dry-stored with a blood level kept high
   (DH), and (c) a wet-stored dialyzer (Rexeed18L, Asahi Kasei Medical)
   with high level (WH). PTX, CRP, Pro-BNP and troponin T were assessed
   before and during 180 min of HD. Results: The mean value of PTX at
   baseline was correlated to Pro-BNP (rho=0.52, p<0.001) and troponin T
   (rho=0.363, p= 0.005), but there was no correlation to CRP. The mean
   value of PTX was significantly increased at 180 min (by 57\%) compared
   to baseline data (p<0.001). The baseline values of PTX correlated with
   the extent of rise of PTX (rho=0.89, p<0.001), such as a higher baseline
   was related with more extensive increase. The mean difference value of
   PTX between baseline to 180 min of HD was correlated to that of
   Pro-BNP(rho=0.31, p=0.025), while there was no correlation to that of
   troponin T nor CRP. PTX rose less while on WH than on DL (mean 2.9 +/-
   1.4 vs 3.8 +/- 2.8, p=0.025). There was no difference in PTX at baseline
   among these three settings. Discussion: These data indicate that PTX is
   a more evident marker for the influence of the cardiac condition than an
   inflammatory marker during HD. Dialysis with WH causes least air
   contamination to the patient what may be a plausible reason for the
   difference.
   Objectives: Amniotic membrane (AM) is applied in variety of clinical
   settings, mainly in wound healing and as a biological dressing.
   Currently, AM is used in ophthalmology for the treatment of cornea
   pathologies. In this study, the regenerative potential of human amniotic
   membrane after cryopreservation was evaluated. Methods: AM was prepared
   under sterile conditions and frozen without cryoprotectants at -80
   degrees C. Native non-cryopreserved AM served as a control. The strategy
   for AM cryopreservation included one or two freezing and thawing cycles.
   Cytokine and growth factor profiles as well as morphology and mechanical
   properties of AM were compared before and after one and two cycles of
   cryopreservation. Levels of EGF, HGF, TGF-beta 1, bFGF, Laminin and
   Hyaluronic acid were measured by ELISA. Surface structure of the
   membrane was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Morphology
   was evaluated by histological analyses after Hematoxylin Eosin (HE)
   staining. Additionally, biomechanical characteristics, such as the
   modulus of elasticity (Young's modulus) and the tensile strength, were
   also investigated. Results: EGF, HGF, TGF-beta 1, bFGF, Laminin and
   Hyaluronic acid were detected in all studied samples. No significant
   differences were detected in the levels of those cytokines before and
   after cryopreservation. SEM analysis showed minor structural alterations
   of double cryopreserved samples. Analysis of HE stained AM showed minor
   changes between native and frozen membranes, such as few areas with
   desquamated epithelium which was caused by repeating freezing and
   thawing cycles. Mechanical tests did not reveal relevant changes between
   frozen and non-frozen samples. Discussion: Multiple cryopreservation
   steps are an essential part of manufacturing of human amniotic membranes
   to ensure a ready-to-use product availability. This study demonstrated
   that the cryopreservation does not impair the regenerative potential of
   AM required to support its therapeutic efficacy.
   Objectives: Cells are used in bioartificial organs (BAOs) to temporarily
   replace the complex metabolic functions that neither failing organs, nor
   their artificial substitutes may provide. This makes cell bioreactors a
   critical technology for BAOs development. Bioreactors are used for
   expanding stem (SCs), precursor (PCs), or line cells to clinical mass,
   for promoting SCs and PCs differentiation to the needed phenotype, and
   for providing patients with the organ regulatory and synthetic functions
   needed to foster organ healing or maintain patients state until
   transplantation (Tx). In some cases, they are also used to regenerate or
   preserve tissue until Tx. The structural and functional complexity of
   tissues and organs, the lack of information on their pathophysiology and
   on disease/damage evolution, the treatment time broadly varying with
   patients disease and state, all make bioreactor design and operation for
   BAOs very challenging. Methods: In spite of its complexity, cell
   bioreactors design for BAOs is generally based on the use of one cell
   type only (often line cells), scaffolds with suitable immune protective
   properties, and bioreactor configurations suitable for hosting clinical
   cell mass and intellectual property protection. Bioreactor performance
   has been enhanced with actuators to provide cells with mechanical,
   electrical and/or magnetic cues, often irrespective of tissue or organ
   specificity. Thus far, this approach has resulted in poor therapeutic
   success of the proposed BAOs. Results: Cell bioreactor design for BAOs
   may benefit of the approaches developed over the years to bioreactor
   design for engineering or regenerating 3D tissue or large solid organs
   in vitro. Discussion: Prospectively, future approaches to cell
   bioreactor design for BAOs should be patterned after those typical of
   tissue engineering and should aim to the optimization of the BAO
   treatment as a whole.
   Objectives: To find the most appropriate lock solution for central
   venous catheters to prevent catheter-related complications. Methods:
   Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were
   systematically searched up to August 2018. We included randomized
   controlled trials comparing different lock solutions for adult dialysis
   patients (> 18 years old). The trials should report at least one primary
   or secondary outcome. Network meta-analyses of outcomes were performed
   using the netmeta 0.9-6 package in R (version 3.5.1). Other analyses
   were carried out by means of the network and network graphs packages in
   Stata version 15.0. Results: 50 trials (7142 patients) were included for
   this study. Compared with heparin 5000U/ml, antibiotic locks
   (antibiotics with TSC, EDTA, heparin 5000U/ml, low-dose heparin, or
   urokinase) and ethanol locks were more effective in preventing
   catheter-related bloodstream infections. Antimicrobial agents plus
   low-dose heparin (500-2500 U/ml), TSC and low-dose heparin locks had
   lower risk of bleeding events than heparin 5000 U/ml. No lock solution
   reduced rates of catheter malfunction and all-cause mortality compared
   with heparin 5000 U/ml. In summary, antibiotics plus low-dose heparin
   was ranked as the best lock solution. Considering the toxicity and drug
   resistance of antibiotics, ethanol could be the alternative
   antimicrobial lock solution. The overall results were not materially
   changed in sensitivity analyses. Discussion: In total, according to the
   two-dimensional graph, antimicrobial agents plus low-dose heparin
   (500-2500 U/ml) was the highest ranking lock solution, as it reduced the
   rates of CRBSI and the risk of bleeding significantly. Ethanol was the
   promising alternative antimicrobial lock solution of antibiotics to
   combine with anticoagulant agents. TSC alone did not prevent CRBSI, but
   it is safe.
   Objectives: The Fontan procedure is the current standard and the best
   palliative treatment for most patients with a functional univentricular
   heart. During the Fontan procedure the caval veins are anastomosed to
   the pulmonary arteries. The resulting total cavopulmonary connection
   (TCPC) allows for the support of an acceptable level of pulmonary
   circulation. At the same time there is the high risk of cardiovascular
   system failure due to the increased load on a single ventricle. In order
   to increase patient survival and quality of life, the different TCPC
   connections aimed at improving blood hemodynamic seems to be a logical
   treatment option. Methods: A CFD study was carried out for four types of
   TCPC (TCPC-1, TCPC-2, TCPC-3, TCPC-4) to determine the optimal
   connection from the point of view of hydraulic and power losses with and
   without the rotary blood pump (RBP) connected. The distribution of
   scalar shear stresses (SSS) in the volume was calculated, allowing for
   evaluation of the effect of the RBP on the blood at the operating point
   of 2.2 l/min and 11 mmHg of head pressure. Results: The results showed
   that the TCPC-3 connection has the optimal geometry, as there is a
   decrease in hydraulic losses corresponding to 5 mmHg, with power losses
   of 0.055 W. Hydraulic losses and power losses for other types of TCPC
   are equal to 6 mmHg and 0.07 W for TCPC-2, 9 mmHg and 0.08 W for TCPC-4,
   10 mmHg and 0.09 W for TCPC-1 respectively. The geometry optimization of
   the TCPC connection can significantly reduce the system losses, but only
   the integration of the RBP prevents these losses even for non-optimal
   TCPC. Discussion: Although the use of a pump has significantly reduced
   losses, the presence of increased SSS can have a negative effect on
   blood. The obtained values of SSS will allow in the future the
   estimation of the degree of blood damage and, as a consequence,
   hemolysis level.
   Objectives: The complex tree-like architecture of the lungs that ends
   with tiny alveolar sacs is difficult to mimic in-vitro. The delicate and
   ultra-thin alveolar barrier with its air-liquid interface is constantly
   exposed to the rhythmic respiratory movements. We report here about two
   organs-on-chip models that uniquely reproduce this environment and in
   which patients `cells are cultured. A first model recapitulates an array
   of alveoli with in-vivo dimensions using a biological stretchable
   membrane. The second model mimics a functional lung capillary network.
   Methods: The key part of the lung alveolar model is a biological
   membrane made of collagen and elastin (CE) that is pipetted on a gold
   mesh, whose pores correspond to the alveolar size (about 200um). Once
   the dried CE-membrane is rehydrated, primary human cells (alveolar
   epithelial and endothelial) can be cultured on both sides. The second
   model is based on the self-assembly of endothelial cells and pericytes
   that are confined in fibrin gel in microengineered compartments.
   Results: A functional alveolar barrier made of primary human alveolar
   epithelial cells and lung endothelial cells is reported. The
   CE-membrane, on which the cells are cultured, is thin (a few
   micrometers), porous (enables the culture of cells at the air-liquid
   interface during several days), and stretchable. The reported lung
   microvasculature made of self-assembled endothelial cells and pericytes
   is perfusable, vasoactive (contracts in presence of phenylephrine, a
   vasoconstrictor) and is permeable. Discussion: These advanced in-vitro
   models enable mimicking the lung parenchymal environment in an
   unprecedented way. As a result, the cultured tissues made of primary
   human lung cells are able to maintain organ-specific functions, such as
   air-blood barrier tightness and microvascular perfusability and
   contractility. Organs-on-chip solutions, such as those presented here,
   may open new possibilities for specific tissue engineering applications.
   Objectives: Development of simple and effective technologies for cell
   storage at positive temperatures facilitates to extend their use and
   ensures safe transport between research and clinical centers. The aim is
   to study the viability and metabolic activity of human mesenchymal
   stromal cells (MSCs) encapsulated in alginate microspheres (AMS) during
   storage at positive temperatures. Methods: The experiments were
   performed on human dermal MSCs derived from adult donors after their
   informed consent. MSCs in suspension and in AMS were stored in sealed
   cryovials at 4, 22 and 37 degrees C. Cell viability and metabolic
   activity were evaluated by MTT- and AlamarBlue-tests and the ability to
   adhere to the culture plastic. Mitochondrial membrane potential was
   assessed with fluorescent dye JC-1. Differentiation potential was
   evaluated after cells induction to osteogenic and adipogenic lineages.
   Results: Encapsulation in AMS supported viability and metabolic activity
   of MSCs during storage in culture medium at ambient temperature at list
   for 3 days. Storage of MSCs under hypothermic conditions (4 degrees C)
   using special media contributed to a longer sustainability of cell
   viability. During storage alginate encapsulated cells retained the
   ability to multilineage differentiation, but had lower metabolic
   activity and mitochondrial membrane potential than cells in monolayer.
   On release from alginate microspheres, the cells were shown to attach,
   reverse metabolic activity and proliferate in a similar manner to that
   seen before encapsulation. Discussion: Encapsulation in alginate
   microspheres may be considered as a cheap and robust alternative to
   cryopreservation for the shirt-term storage and transport of cells for
   clinical and research projects.
   Objectives: In case of organ failure, several options can theoretically
   be considered, thanks to the progresses in medicine, materials science
   and biotechnology: i) transplant the same organ from a donor, ii)
   replace the functions of the failing organ by an artificial one, iii)
   repair its structure thanks to cell therapy or iv) engineer a new one in
   vitro before its implantation. Methods: As far as abdominal organs
   (kidney, liver, pancreas), the history of organ replacement follows
   different ways that will be considered. In addition to medical and
   scientific hurdles, economical or ethical issues can drive the choices
   for the ``best{''} solution for the patient. Results: The case of
   pancreas is very specific since its transplantation is not the first
   option chosen to treat the failing organs, whereas it represents the
   gold standard for the liver and the kidney. In the case of liver, we
   still have to face the lack of purely artificial organ to treat acute
   liver failure or even chronic disease. Discussion: This is due to the
   complexity of the organs and the variety of its functions, some of them
   remaining relatively unknown. In this case, the option of engineering
   new liver in vitro combining hepatic cells of different phenotypes with
   an adequate matrix allowing high blood perfusion appears as the most
   promising option. Several approaches have been proposed, starting from
   the ``basic{''} use of a semi-permeable hollow fiber membrane to host
   the cells to the bioprinting of the whole organ. We will discuss here
   the pros and cons of these different strategies.
   SensorStim Neurotechnology GmbH is a start-up of the TU Berlin. The
   business area is medical engineering based on neurostimulation and
   eHealth for rehabilitation and homecare. Our vision is to help people
   with limited mobility due to paralysis, spasticity or pain and to
   mobilize them with technical assistance. Our novel medical device
   enables the use of noninvasive neurostimulation for rehabilitation and
   therapy of people with disabilities after damage to the central nervous
   system - brain, spinal cord, pyramidal tract. It is mobile, easy to use
   and it can be used in water, too. Our device consists of a
   neurostimulator combined with body sensors and can be operated via a
   smart App. Furthermore, it can be used for clinical and home care. After
   a successful market entry, we further want to support walking, cycling
   and aqua gymnastics with electrical stimulation. We started in 2018 and
   are currently funded by grants of the Federal Ministry of Education and
   Research (BMBF), Investitionsbank Berlin (IBB) and private equity and
   development cooperations. By the end of 2019, we plan to achieve CE
   marking for our first product and ISO 13485 certification for our
   quality management system.
   Objectives: Intraventricular flow patterns during mechanical circulatory
   support (MCS) cannot be accessed by clinical imaging; therefore, either
   computational or in-vitro models are used. However, the complex anatomy
   of the heart cannot be replicated and simulations inherently rely on
   assumptions and simplifications. In an isolated porcine heart setup the
   feasibility of flow measurements by Echocardiographic Particle Image
   Velocimetry (E-PIV) was evaluated. Methods: Similar to cardiac
   transplantation, porcine hearts (n=8, animal weight: 80-106 kg) were
   excised and connected to the isolated heart setup. After resuscitation
   using blood as perfusate, a rotary blood pump was implanted,
   microbubbles were injected via the left atrium at different support
   situations and echocardiographic 3-chamber-view B-mode images were
   recorded with the highest possible frame rate of up to 141 Hz (Philips
   iE33, X5-1 xMatrix probe). By iterative PIV algorithms using correlation
   domain averaging and beam sweep correction, flow fields were evaluated
   for the different hemodynamic situations. Results: All hearts were
   successfully resuscitated in the isolated heart setup and different
   hemodynamic situations were adjusted. In the unsupported heart
   physiologic flow patterns with a large clockwise vortex structure that
   warrants washout of the whole cardiac chamber were found. With
   increasing MCS (2200-2700 rpm) the formation of this flow feature is
   diminished caused by the additional flow sink at the apex. In full
   support, without aortic valve opening in the left ventricular outflow
   tract, a stagnant structure was identified, that might be connected to
   thromboembolic events. Discussion: For the first time, the contribution
   of the mitral valve apparatus to blood flow patterns especially in the
   LVOT, which may be linked to energy loss, thrombus formation and valve
   deterioration during MCS was investigated under realistic conditions.
   Objectives: In order to determine the most effective ratio of liver
   cells (LC) and multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells of bone marrow (MSC
   BM) into implantable cell-engineering constructs (CECs) used for a
   correcting of chronic liver failure (CLF). Methods: In order to create
   liver CECs we employed a biopolymer implant - a composition of a
   heterogeneous collagen-containing gel, which concluded viable LC and MSC
   BM in ratios:1:1, 5:1 and 10:1 respectively. CECs with different ratios
   of LC and MSC BM were implanted into the livers of rats (n=40) in which
   CLF was modeled by using CCl4. The efficiency of the regulatory effects
   of CECs (with different cell ratios) on regenerative processes in livers
   were assessed by using biochemical, morphological and morphometric
   methods at different periods after their implantation. Results: During
   studying of the liver CECs with various ratios of LC and MSC BM (1:1,
   5:1, 10:1), it was found that the most optimal ratio of cells into the
   CECs was 5:1, because at such ratio of cells the most distinct
   normalization of morphological and functional liver parameters as well
   as maintenance of the structural homeostasis within the CECs took place
   within 365 days after modeling CLF. Discussion: The effective correction
   of CLF can be carried out by using the implanted liver CECs, in which
   donor liver cells and MSC BM are presented in ratios - 1:1, 5:1 and
   10:1. But analysis of prolonged correction of liver morphological and
   functional parameters at CECs using allows to recommend the preference
   using of CECs using with ratio 5:1, because prolonged preservation of
   structural homeostasis into themselves CECs makes possible to
   prognosticate their prolonged regulatory action on the liver tissue at
   CLF, especially for recipients on a waiting list for liver
   transplantation.
   Conventional hemolysis researches were performed under mainly constant
   shear stress, however, real flow in vivo would be under fluctuating
   shear stress. In addition, several conventional numerical simulations
   predicted abrupt shear stress fluctuation in the blood pumps in short
   time period. Furthermore, it was also reported that erythrocyte showed
   its unique viscoelastic shape change response to sinusoidal changing
   shear stress. Based on such information, we hypothesized that abrupt
   shear change would be additional hemolysis factor in addition to
   conventional shear stress and its exposure time. Therefore, the purpose
   of this study was to examine the feasibility of such our hypothesis. We
   developed special cylindrical shear chamber which can generate varying
   shear stress by controlling the rotational speed. This study used the
   shear device to generate several trapezoidal waveforms of shear
   stresses. In such shear fluctuation, the maximal shear stress of
   approximate 22.5 Pa were loaded to porcine whole blood for 5.0 seconds.
   And the time series integrated shear stress was set to equal between
   abrupt and slow shear change conditions. Then, generated hemolysis
   levels were compared between them. Each comparative studies were
   performed for twelve times. Furthermore, such studies were repeated
   under several different shear change speeds. The result of our all
   comparison showed greater hemolysis amount at abruptly fluctuating shear
   condition. Such results successfully validated our hypothesis.
   Objectives: Ex vivo platelet production in microfluidic bioreactors is a
   promising alternative to platelet donation for transfusion therapy.
   Platelets are formed by fragmentation of large bone marrow cells called
   megakaryocytes (MK). Hydrodynamic forces play a major role in the
   formation of platelets. In this work, we design microfluidic chips where
   isolated MK are exposed to hydrodynamic forces and we characterize their
   elongation and fragmentation. Methods: Polydimethylsiloxane chips are
   fabricated using standard soft lithography protocols and sealed to a
   glass slide. The 50 mu m deep rectangular chambers contain rows of 30 mu
   m-wide adhesive pillars. Human CD34+ cells isolated from umbilical cord
   blood are differentiated in vitro for 12 days to yield mature MK and
   infused with a concentration of 2x10(5) /mL into the chips at a wall
   shear rate of 1800s(-1). Their elongation and fragmentation is monitored
   by videomicroscopy. Images were analysed using ImageJ. Results: We
   perform a spatio-temporal analysis of MK elongation and show that
   platelet release is always preceded by a remodeling of the cell that
   spans over about 20 minutes, followed by a local, sudden increase in
   elongation velocity (5-fold increase in the 10 seconds prior to
   fragmentation). The amplitude of these variations is much larger than
   the spatial and temporal variations in the surrounding flow field.
   Discussion: Earlier studies have shown that dynamic conditions for in
   vitro platelet production not only accelerates the process but also
   enhances the quality of released platelets. Here, we show that MK
   elongation and fragmentation, though accelerated by the flow, are not
   solely governed by fluid-structure interactions. It seems that other
   mechanisms are involved in the regulation of platelet release,
   preventing it to occur before the platelet is fully functional.
   Objectives: The Eulerian version of the strain-based hemolysis model has
   already shown to predict different critical regions in blood pumps
   compared to the commonly used stress-based models. Where the
   stress-based model assumes an instantaneous deformation of red blood
   cells (RBCs) due to the action of fluid forces, the strain-based model
   is able to estimate the viscoelastic deformation of RBCs. Thus, the
   effect of exposure time is considered in a natural way. However, both
   models are based on the empirical power law assumption for hemoglobin
   transport and turned out to overpredict hemolysis compared to
   experimental data. In order to improve the prediction of free-plasma
   hemoglobin, the strain-based model is combined with a multiscale model
   for hemoglobin transport. The model is able to account for pore
   formation in the RBC membrane and the resulting hemoglobin mass transfer
   into the blood plasma. Thus, the model does not rely on the power law
   assumption. Methods: The formation of pores is computed based on an
   energy balance of the stretched RBC membrane, where an area strain can
   be computed by the tensor equation of the strain-based model. The
   hemoglobin release is modeled by a transport equation with a mass
   transfer coefficient as a function of shear, which can be fitted to the
   data of blood shearing experiments. As an application, the model is used
   for a benchmark blood pump provided by the FDA. Results: The estimated
   total hemolytic performance for the benchmark blood pump is
   significantly reduced compared to the power law version of the
   strain-based model. The new results are in good agreement with the
   measured data by the FDA. Discussion: The multiscale model for
   hemoglobin transport turns out to be a useful extension of the
   strain-based hemolysis model, allowing for an overall more physical
   model description of the hemolysis process. Application to different
   devices and blood shearing experiments should be investigated in the
   future, in order to study the parameter sensitivity.
   Objectives: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane enclosed
   structures, which are released from all types of cells upon activation.
   Two examples for the role of EVs in extracorporeal therapies will be
   discussed in detail, (i) EVs as markers for cellular activation and (ii)
   EVs as platform for the binding of plasma proteins. We assessed the
   impact of regional citrate anticoagulation (2.8 vs. 5.6 mM) on the
   cellular activation in lipoprotein apheresis, using EVs as marker for
   cellular activation upon blood-adsorbent interaction. Moreover, we
   studied the ability of a commercial adsorbent (PentraSorb) for
   C-reactive protein (CRP) to remove both, soluble and EV-associated CRP
   from septic plasma. Methods: EVs were characterized in human blood or
   plasma via flow cytometry after calibration with fluorescent silica
   beads (1 mu m, 0.5 mu m, 0.3 mu m; Kisker Biotech).
   Phosphatidylserine-exposing EVs were identified as lactadherin-positive
   events in the EV gate. Antibodies against cell specific surface markers
   (CD41 for platelets, CD235a for red blood cells) were used to identify
   the cellular origin of EVs. An anti-CRP antibody was used to identify
   CRP carrying EVs. Results: During lipoprotein apheresis, platelet
   adhesion to the adsorbent polymer and EV release were associated with
   elevated markers for platelet activation and EV release was dependent on
   the citrate concentration in the extracorporeal circuit. Septic plasma
   contained significantly elevated levels of EVs, CRP+ EVs, as well as
   soluble CRP as compared to healthy donors. Incubation of plasma with the
   CRP adsorbent resulted in almost complete depletion of soluble CRP, and
   remaining EVs did not show any association with CRP, indicating
   detachment of CRP from the EVs. Discussion: In the context of apheresis,
   EVs can be considered as markers for cellular activation. Moreover, our
   data show that EVs can serve as a platform for the binding of CRP, which
   has been suggested to induce conformational changes of CRP and a shift
   towards pro-inflammatory characteristics.
   Objectives: In developing endovascular treatment devices, understanding
   their physical properties is one of the most important points. We have
   been developed film-type sensor for force measurement, applied to the
   field of biomechanics. In this study, the blood vessel model embedded
   pressure film sensor was fabricated and the contact pressure
   distribution in the circumferential direction was measured at balloon
   dilatation. Methods: The film sensor was constructed by a couple of
   patterned electrodes and pressure-sensitive layer. The film sensor was
   rolled and embedded to straight-shape silicone vessel model. The balloon
   catheter was expanded in a mock vessel. Results: The measured pressure
   at the mock vessel increased according to balloon dilatation pressure.
   At expanding of general balloon, the measured pressure at each point was
   almost the same. When expanding a scoring balloon, a balloon with wedge
   elements, the measured pressure at wedge contact points was higher than
   that of the other parts. Discussion: It is considerable that stress
   concentration state changes depending on the wedge shape and/or
   stiffness. The mock vessel is useful to understand dilatation property
   of scoring balloon.
   Objectives: Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is used to treat
   acute respiratory and circulatory failure. Recent advancements have led
   to impressive improvements in treatment results. Now clinicians urge for
   an ever-earlier ECMO application and a broadening of the indications:
   Mobility demand -> Every ECMO patient needs to be transported under
   severely restricted space conditions. Cost demand -> With rising ECMO
   numbers the cost ratio plays an increasing role for healthcare
   economics. Methods: A novel system uses a recombination of existing
   technologies to create a straightforward solution with a size and
   complexity reduction. The key principle is the sourcing of pump energy
   from the oxygen pressure, which is required to ventilate the oxygenator
   anyway. This modification allows a purely pneumatic operation and the
   usage of pulsatile pumps. Results: A pneumatically powered dual chamber
   pulsatile pump has been developed which avoids suction and high shear
   rates with improved wash out behaviour for the entire ECC system. The
   innovative pump is driven completely pneumatically without a complex and
   expensive driving console. Furthermore, a novel oxygenator has been
   developed. Initial prototypes of pumps and oxygenators have been
   optimized during multiple design iterations and tested in terms
   hydraulic characteristics and gas exchange properties on the bench using
   water glycerol and porcine blood. The entire system has a reduced
   surface area and priming volume and shows low internal pressure loss,
   excellent wash out and gas exchange parameters. The bench test results
   have been confirmed within a chronic GLP in vivo study in large animals.
   The new device's size and complexity have been significantly reduced
   compared to the state of the art systems. Discussion: The novel approach
   brings many advantages for the next generation ECMO/ECLS systems
   particularly in terms of function, mobility and cost-effectiveness.
   Objectives: The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)
   standards recommend bovine blood for in vitro testing of medical
   devices. Haemodilution is used to standardise haematocrit (HCT) to 30
   +/- 2\% with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Research has shown that
   PBS increases red blood cell mechanical fragility and significantly
   increases haemolysis. Thus, the objective of this study was to
   investigate the impact of diluent and dilution for in vitro testing,
   which may result in future considerations for ASTM standards. Methods:
   Bovine blood was diluted with either PBS or PBS+4g\% BSA (bovine serum
   albumin) to a HCT of 30 +/- 2\%. The blood was either pumped with the
   CentriMag (R) (Thoratec,USA) device under haemodynamic conditions or
   exposed to VAD-like shear for 6 hours. Blood was diluted to a range of
   70-94\% (n=40). Plasma free haemoglobin levels were measured to
   calculate the normalised index of haemolysis (NIH). Protein
   concentrations were measured. Results: Haemodilution altered mechanical
   fragility depending on diluent and concentration. At a 70\% blood
   dilution, PBS alone caused significantly higher haemolysis than PBS+4g\%
   BSA. However, at a 90\% blood dilution, PBS+4g\% BSA caused
   significantly higher haemolysis than PBS alone. As such, a positive
   correlation was observed between dilution with PBS alone and NIH,
   whereas a negative correlation was observed between dilution with
   PBS+4g\% BSA and NIH. Total protein concentration was significantly
   reduced at a 70\% blood dilution with PBS alone but not at 90\%.
   Discussion: To reach a HCT of 30\%+/- 2\%, this study recommends that
   bovine blood with a HCT of > 37\% should be diluted with PBS + 4g\% BSA
   (>80\% blood dilution), whereas blood with a HCT of <37\% should be
   diluted with PBS alone (<80\% blood dilution). Haemodilution with BSA
   maintains physiological protein concentrations and may reduce bias
   during haemolysis testing with high dilutions. Thus, ASTM standards
   could consider including BSA as a diluent, when needed.
   Objectives: Obtaining normal serum potassium level is an important goal
   in maintenance hemodialysis patients. Hyperkalemia is known to be
   associated with mortality. In this study we aimed to access the
   relationship between pre-dialysis potassium level, nutritional status
   and survival in dialysis patients. Methods: This study used annual
   cohort of hemodialysis patients with 36 months of follow up. To
   determine the impact of potassium level on mortality, patients were
   followed from first potassium measurement until death or a censoring
   event; hypokalemia was defined by potassium levels below 5.5 mmol/l and
   albumin levels below 35g/l was considered an index for undernourished.
   Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to estimate the
   association between potassium level and mortality. Results: 199 patients
   were included in the study. Mean age was approximately 56 years, about
   59\% were men and 23\% had end-stage renal disease caused by diabetes.
   Albumin below 35g/l was observed in 26 (13\%) of the patients. In the
   follow up period 40 (20\%) patients died, comprising 24 (32\%) of the 74
   hypokalemic and 16 (19\%) of 82 hyperkalemic patients. The Kaplan-Meier
   survival rate was significantly longer in the hyperkalemic population
   (34.30 +/- 0.71 vs 31.06 +/- 1.16, p=0.055). Hypokalemia, when defined
   as serum potassium 5.5 pound mmol/l, was associated with all-cause
   mortality (hazards ratio (HR) 1.857, 95\% CI 0.986-3.496, p = 0.051).
   The significance was lost in the model after adjustment for albumin
   level. Only albumin level determined mortality (p=0.03). Discussion:
   Lower potassium level was associated with all-cause mortality, but only
   as a confounding effect of malnutrition in dialysis patients
   Objectives: A new method to adhere biological tissue to another or to
   metal such as stainless steel using integrated low-level energy sources,
   heat, pressure, and vibration is proposed. Methods: Heat, pressure, and
   vibration are simultaneously delivered by pressing the porcine aorta
   tissues on the vibration plate with the heated tip. Tensile tests on
   adhered specimens were performed to determine adhesion characteristics
   to adhesion temperature, time, pressure, and vibration. The effect of
   metal surface coating, fluorine-doped DLC coating, on the adhesion
   strength was examined. In one application, the inlet port of a
   ventricular assist device adhered to a porcine ventricle muscle by
   applying the novel method with a temperature of 80 degrees Centigrade
   for 120 seconds. Sufficient adhesion was observed without additional
   vibration. In a second application, the vessel adhesion apparatus was
   developed to connect a bypass graft to a coronary artery. The device has
   both a heating and pressurizing part on the tip, which was used to
   attach the bypass graft to the coronary artery by applying heat with a
   temperature of 120 degrees Centigrade for 120 seconds. Results and
   Discussion: The maximal shear tensile strength using the proposed novel
   adhesion method was 200 kPa, which is half the strength of the porcine
   aorta. Adhesion strength increased in proportion to temperature, time,
   and pressure. The adhesion strength can be controlled by surface
   treatment of metals. In the first application, the inlet port adhered to
   the ventricle muscle with a shear tensile strength of 91 kPa, which is
   enough to keep the pump attached to the ventricle. In the second
   application, the bypass graft adhered to the coronary artery with a
   shear tensile strength of 50 kPa, which is sufficient to maintain
   attachment when exposed to normal blood pressure. The proposed adhesion
   method indicates satisfactory performance.
   Objectives: The requirements for safety and efficacy of medical devices
   are constantly increasing leading to higher costs and time to market.
   Simulations are proving to be particularly promising in accelerating the
   approval process and at the same time further increasing patient safety.
   The FDA related Medical Device Innovation Consortium predicts that in
   some years about 40\% of the evidences for regulatory approval are
   coming from virtual patients and simulations. What is the status today
   and how do we get there? Methods: Simulations can improve the regulatory
   assessment in various phases of the product life cycle, e.g. to justify
   design adjustments, worst-case estimates of sizes and variants,
   definition of test loads for experiments, to perform virtual tests on a
   large number of patients/conditions or to identify the root cause of
   failure. This may especially be important in consideration of the future
   requirements of the MDR for patient-specific implants. Results: So far,
   the use of simulations was hindered by a lack of guidance and
   expectations within the medical device community. However, today the FDA
   and ASME are strongly supporting the use of this approach with new
   guidelines (guidance 1807) and a V\&V standard (V\&V40). ``FDA's Office
   of Science and Engineering Laboratories has committed significant
   resources for transforming computational modeling from a valuable
   scientific tool to a valuable regulatory tool because of its potential
   for significant cost-savings in evaluating medical devices, simulating
   performance under scenarios that may not be possible with human use or
   that could more effectively be evaluated with simulation.{''}
   Discussion: Computer-aided simulations have the potential to
   revolutionize the field of regulatory approval. However, it is crucial
   that the simulations are performed with care and its limitations are
   understood. To foster confidence and wider acceptance of in silico
   methods, a proper methodology is needed to ensure appropriate
   credibility.
   Objectives: TAVI is the treatment of severe aortic valve stenosis in
   elderly patients or in patients with too high risk for conventional
   surgery. CT-scan is mandatory for valve sizing. It requires injection of
   contrast medium that may cause or increase kidney failure. The study aim
   was to establish the accuracy of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), a no
   contrast medium technique, for measurements of native aortic valve in
   patients undergoing TAVI. Values by IVUS were compared to CT-scan ones
   in the same patients. Methods: From June 2014 to January 2019 137
   consecutive patients (74 M, mean age 82.7 +/- 5.6 years) (Logistic
   EuroSCORE 22.7 +/- 14.9\%; STS score mortality 21.3 +/- 13.7\%)
   undergoing TAVI through femoral access were enrolled. Each patient had
   high resolution angio-CT for these measurements: diameter, perimeter,
   and area of the aortic annulus. In all patients, during procedure and
   before prosthetic valve implantation, a manual IVUS pullback, from left
   ventricular outflow tract to ascending aorta, was performed by 7F IVUS
   probe. On the recorded IVUS pullback, a second operator blind to CT
   measures sized minimum and maximum diameter, perimeter and area of the
   aortic annulus. In order to assess inter-rater concordance and agreement
   between CT and IVUS data, Bland-Altman analysis and Pearson's
   correlation were applied. A p value Results: A very strong correlation
   was found between the measures. Maximum diameter: CT 2.5 +/- 0.3 vs IVUS
   2.6 +/- 0.3 cm; r=+0.985; pDiscussion: These results prove the accuracy
   and reliability of aortic annulus measurements by IVUS compared to those
   by CT-scan. Sizing of the aortic annulus by IVUS only may be considered
   in patients likely to develop kidney failure due to contrast medium
   injection.
   Objectives: The long-term usage of rotary blood pumps is limited by the
   high amount of blood damage, which leads to a high number of adverse
   events. Most of the blood damage is generated in the gap between the
   rotor blades and the housing wall, the area with the highest stress load
   and very short exposure times. The damage is caused by both shear and
   normal forces on the blood components. The objective is to investigate
   the blood damage in this region by examining different gap geometries.
   The focus is the damage caused by high dynamic normal stresses and the
   comparison with the blood damage models. Methods: A section of the blade
   gap of an axial rotary blood pump was reconstructed on a microchannel
   chip, which is sealed with siliconized cover glasses. In additional
   channels the inlet and outlet rounding are varied between 0.05 and 0.6
   mm. The gap length and width are kept the same for all channels. A
   channel without a blade gap is integrated to determine the damage caused
   by the test stand. Flow simulations are carried out to determine the
   occurring stresses. The test stand consists of a syringe pump that
   transports 20 mL of human blood back and forth through the microchannels
   for up to 6 hours. Hemolysis is measured every half hour. Results: With
   the test stand it is possible to investigate the influence of different
   gap geometries on the blood damage under controlled conditions. The
   experiments demonstrated the influence of different inlet and outlet
   geometries on the hemolysis. The measured hemolysis was compared with
   the damage models. Discussion: With the test stand it is possible to
   simulate the stress loads in blade gaps on human blood. The influence of
   the high dynamic normal stresses on hemolysis can also be determined
   through variations of the inlet and outlet. It is therefore a
   well-suited tool for improving the corresponding damage models in the
   area of high dynamic stress loads. The findings allow the optimization
   of the region to further reduce blood damage caused by rotary blood
   pumps.
   Objectives: Cardiac grafts produced by combining human pluripotent stem
   cell (hPSC)-derivatives and tissue engineering are a promising
   therapeutic option for the replacement of cardiomyocytes (CM) lost due
   to myocardial infarction. Currently, the vascularization and maturation
   of such grafts are the most critical aspects. In addition to endothelial
   cells (EC), pericytes (PC) are known to play a crucial role in vessel
   development and stabilization. Methods: Here, an hPSC-derived PC
   differentiation protocol is shown as well as an in vitro model for the
   investigation of the role of PCs in hPSC-derived bioartificial cardiac
   tissues (BCT). Results: In the established differentiation protocol, the
   population giving rise to PCs (CD31-/PDGFR beta+) represented up to 94\%
   of all cells and could be further purified via cell sorting. The
   obtained hPSC-PCs exhibited functional characteristics of PCs in
   co-culture assays, and showed similar gene expression profile to primary
   PCs. Differentiated hPSC-PCs were used w/ or w/o purified hPSC-ECs to
   generate BCTs and to address their effect on tissue morphology,
   metabolism, and electrophysiological parameters compared to control
   tissues containing primary fibroblasts (Fb). Interestingly, tissues with
   hPSC-PCs exhibited equivalent contraction forces compared to controls,
   but more organized sarcomere structures as well as improved longitudinal
   cell- and extracellular matrix orientation. Furthermore, the beating
   frequency and passive forces showed native-like values. Addition of
   hPSC-ECs resulted in spontaneously formed and maintained endothelial
   network structures, which were distributed throughout the BCTs and the
   involvement of PCs in such structures was demonstrated. Discussion: The
   characterized and functional hPSC-PCs together with hPSC-derived CMs and
   ECs represent a promising cell source for myocardial tissue replacement
   therapy. Their dual ability in supporting EC function and matrix
   remodeling during tissue maturation makes them a favorable candidate to
   replace primary Fbs.
   Objectives: High prevalence of thrombi around the Left Ventricular
   Assist Device (LVAD) cannula has been proven by pathological studies.
   Thrombogenic potential (TP) inside of the left ventricle (LV) is
   evaluated based on shear stress history (SSH) and residence time (RT) of
   particles; however, the effect of the atrial inflow - including rotation
   and uneven flow distribution of the pulmonary veins - is ignored. In
   this study, the influence of the atrial inflow on the TP was
   investigated via Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations.
   Methods: In a patient-specific left ventricle (LV) model under full LVAD
   support, the flow fields were simulated with three different inflow
   conditions: with perpendicular velocity to the inflow (LAper, flow rate:
   3.5l/min), with an additional rotational component at the inflow (LArot:
   35rpm) and with asymmetric inflow conditions (LAasym: 60\%/40\%
   left/right). Platelet motion was simulated with a combination of laminar
   and the Lagrangian methods for 7s. The TP value was calculated based on
   the RT and SSH of particles (0<TP<1, with higher values corresponding to
   higher risk). Results: The ventricular flow patterns were comparable for
   perpendicular and rotational inflows and different for asymmetric
   conditions. TP values were different for each of the atrial inflow
   conditions (LAasym: 0.37, LArot: 0.35, LAper: 0.4). The number of the
   particles with a SSH value more than 0.6 Pa center dot s (non-outlier
   range) increased for LAasym simulation (LAasym: 11\%, LArot: 5\%, LAper:
   3\%;p<0.05); however the particles that remain for more than 7s inside
   the LV were higher for LAper simulation (LAasym: 13\%, LArot: 18\%,
   LAper: 19\%;p<0.05). Discussion: CFD is an advanced tool for the
   evaluation of ventricular flow during LVAD support; however, neglecting
   the atrial inflow conditions could lead to an inaccurate prediction of
   flow parameters linked to ventricular and pump thrombosis. Reliable
   evaluation of ventricular blood flow, therefore, requires the
   consideration of realistic atrial inflow conditions.
   Objectives: Thrombus formation is a major risk of implants with
   artificial materials in blood contact. This adhesion of blood platelets
   plays an important role in thrombus formation and is influenced by the
   electrochemical conditions of the surface. The objective of this
   research is to change the electrochemical conditions by applying a low
   voltage, high frequency alternating electrical current to the surface,
   in order to avoid the adhesion of the platelets involved in thrombus
   formation. Methods: Thin sheet samples with a thickness of 0.5 mm from
   different materials (titanium, stainless steel and copper) are attached
   to a high frequency generator and exposed to human whole blood under
   controlled flow conditions in an in vitro setting. An electrical current
   ranging from 50 mu A until 400 mu A in a frequency range from 10 kHz to
   100 kHz was applied. The deposition of the blood platelets on the
   surface is identified and quantified by using fluorescent microscopy and
   digital image processing. The thrombus formation and therefore the
   anti-thrombogenic effect of the method is investigated in respect to
   different generator settings for each material. Results: The
   characterization of all materials revealed changes of the surfaces in
   comparison to the zero samples. A differently pronounced reduction of
   thrombus formation with the proposed anti-thrombogenic method could be
   demonstrated on all three materials. Discussion: Though the method could
   improve the anti-thrombogenicity under certain conditions, the mechanism
   is not fully understood yet and the parameters are not optimized.
   Further investigations will also focus on possible side effects caused
   by potential structural changes of blood proteins.
   Objectives: Cationic liposomes OO4 (N-\{6-amino-1-{[}N-(9Z)
   -octadec9-enylamino] -1-oxohexan-(2S) -2-yl\} -N0- \{2- {[}N,
   N-bis(2-aminoethyl) amino] ethyl\} -2-hexadecylpropandiamide) and DOPE
   contain a higher amount of amino groups than classical lipids. A
   polyelectrolyte multilayer system (PEM) made of chondroitin sulphate
   (CS) and collagen type I (COL I) was prepared by Layer-by-Layer
   technique with liposomes embedded in the terminal layers for the
   controlled release of components to promote osteogenic differentiation
   for bone regeneration. Methods: Characterization of the PEM was
   performed using ellipsometry. This technique was used to investigate the
   thickness on substrate coated with PEM of CS, liposomes, COL I as
   terminal layer. The layer growth behavior of PEM was studied using
   Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). The cell adhesion of C2C12 cells and
   the cellular uptake efficiency of the liposomes embedded onto PEM was
   evaluated using fluorescence staining and flow cytometry. Results: The
   SPR results showed a linear growth with an increase in the angle shift
   corresponding to the adsorbed mass of PEM. The increase in thickness
   after liposome adsorption was significant. The cell studies indicated
   that cells seeded on terminal liposome layer showed a higher amount of
   cells on the surface. The population of cells that took up liposomes are
   higher in the absence of serum than in medium with FBS. Discussion: The
   quantification of liposome uptake indicated that the population of cells
   that took up liposomes were higher in the absence of serum. The results
   showed the uptake efficiency of cationic liposomes embedded onto a PEM
   system for controlled release of hydrophobic and hydrophilic models
   compounds into the cells.
   Objectives: Many different tissue sealants are available on the market.
   BioGlue tissue sealants are produced by a bovine serum albumin treated
   intra-operatively with glutaraldehyde. Here we report a sterile
   peri-graft abscess formation, possibly caused as a reaction to the
   liberal use of BioGlue. Methods: A-54 years-old male patient underwent
   ascending aortic and hemiarch replacement for acute type A aortic
   dissection. Exceptionally, the anastomotic suture line was reinforced by
   application of BioGlue tissue sealant. The initial post-operative course
   was uneventful. After transfer to the general ward on day four the
   patient developed fever and an inflammatory syndrome. A broad spectrum
   antibiotherapy was started for a suspicion of pneumonia. In the
   following chest CT scan a suspicious peri-graft fluid collection was
   present. The patient underwent a surgical revision for acute
   mediastinitis rule out. During the procedure a whitish-milky liquid was
   found that differed macroscopically from a classical abscess. The chest
   was left open with a negative-pressure wound dressing. The patient
   became apyretic and the inflammatory markers normalized. After a one
   week follow-up with negative cultures and 3 consecutive dressing
   changes, the chest was closed and recovery uneventful. The patient was
   discharged to an outside hospital at six post-operative days. Results:
   All the samples which were analysed histologically and for different
   pathologic stains as well as and by broad spectrum culture analysis,
   remained negative throughout. At one month follow-up the patient
   remained well and without fever or inflammatory response. Discussion:
   Although several published case reports about tissue necrosis and
   anastomotic rupture following BioGlue use, the formation of a sterile
   abscess is a rare complication. In this patient, the peri-graft effusion
   might have been an allergy like inflammatory response to the bovine
   albumin within BioGlue. A prolonged postoperative mediastinal drainage
   when using BioGlue might prevent this rare complication.
   Objectives: The use of loop diuretics like furosemide is discussed in
   intensive care medicine regarding their clinical efficacy and safety.
   The hypothesis arose whether both parameters depend on the capability of
   serum albumin to transfer the drug to the kidneys. Methods: Serial blood
   \& urine samples were taken from intensive care patients receiving
   furosemide infusions for volume overload. Free furosemide serum
   fractions \& urine concentrations were determined by HPLC/LCMS. Albumin
   binding capacity (ABiC) was quantified by adding a binding site II
   (diazepam binding site) specific fluorescence marker (Dansylsarcosine,
   DS). The amount of unbound DS was detected by fluorescence analysis
   after ultrafiltration, corresponding with ABiC. Results: 62 patients
   were assessed. 50 patients (30male, 67,5 +/- 10,3 years) were included
   into statistical analysis. Main reasons for intensive care admission
   were sepsis (n=18) and perioperative care. Indications for furosemide
   were volume overload in acute or acute on chronic kidney injury (n=42),
   volume management in sepsis, ARDS or lung edema (n=8). ABiC was reduced
   to 65,2+/-12,2\%, The free furosemide fraction (normal <5\%) correlated
   negatively with ABiC (r -0,638, p<0,001) with 15,76+/-11,52\% in those
   with ABIC<60\% and 5,36+/-5,29\% in ABiC 60\% (p<0,001). The urinary
   fraction of furosemide (normal >65\%) was significantly lower in those
   with ABiC <60\% as compared to 60\% (7,47+/-5,83\% vs. 23,98+/-17,91,
   p<0,01). Furosemide induced increase in urine output was strongly
   correlated with ABiC (r=0,908, p<0,017). Discussion: Our results
   indicate a role of ABiC in the pharmacokinetics of furosemide, impacting
   its free serum fraction and urinary fraction. Data are suggestive for a
   link between status of the albumin-dependend drug carrier mechanism and
   the safety and efficacy of the drug. Clinicians will profit from our
   results regarding safe use of loop diuretics \& furosemide
   responsiveness in patients with volume overload and kidney injury.
   Objectives: Albumin is a blood protein with various physiological
   functions as there are: maintenance of osmotic pressure, antioxidant and
   transport function for endogenous and exogenous ligands. Binding of
   these ligands can affect conformational changes of human serum albumin.
   Methods: The ``Albumin-functionality-test{''} is based on EPR
   spectroscopy and detects modified binding and functional
   characteristics. The used radical supporting spin probe binds analogous
   ligands variably strong at different albumin binding sites and thus,
   serves as an indirect marker for serum albumin functionality with regard
   to its ability for binding, transport and detoxification. A comparison
   of three different mixtures of albumin and a spin-labeled fatty acid
   allows for the in vitro simulation of binding-, transport- and
   release-conditions by the Albumin-functionality-test. Thus, an
   ``effective{''} albumin concentration could be determined. It quantifies
   the amount of functional albumin in the patient in comparison to healthy
   controls. Results: We applied Albumin-functionality-test to albumin
   preparations differing in redox state of cysteine-34, namely human
   mercaptalbumin (HMA), human non-mercaptalbumin1 (HNA1) and human
   non-mercaptalbumin2 (HNA2) and found differences in their functionality.
   The analysis of samples from patients with different states of liver
   failure showed a strong correlation of binding efficiency and
   detoxification efficiency, depending on the severity of the disease.
   Discussion: Due to the increasing numbers of studies using commercial
   albumin preparations for the treatment of patients with liver disease,
   we investigated different available albumin samples regarding their
   albumin functionality. We found dramatically reduced binding and
   detoxification efficiencies. Our findings might be used for patient
   selection and prognoses for personalized therapies. Taken together,
   these results might affect the importance of albumin from the patient
   view and refer to its stability as a drug.
   Objectives: The analysis of Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) power
   is a commonly used method to identify complications such as pump
   thrombosis. However, the LVAD power is also affected by different
   influences like the circadian rhythm. To optimize our thrombosis
   detection algorithm, we analyzed LVAD log files. Methods: For the
   investigation of power behavior in LVAD log files, we retrospectively
   analyzed 840 log files from 189 patients. Each patient received an HVAD
   (HeartWare). The log files contain on average 3000 power values
   collected over a period of appx. 31 days. None of the analyzed log files
   contained serious complications, such as a pump thrombosis. Results: To
   show a significant difference between the power values of the daytime (8
   am-10 pm) and the night-time, a statistical test (significance level:
   5\%) was carried out. 813 of 840 log files showed a significant
   difference (average t = 16.94). In addition, the average difference
   between the maximum and the minimum power value of a day was calculated
   for each day (average: 1071.9mW, SD: 158.2mW, range: 497.1mW -
   2299.5mW). Furthermore, the average power was calculated for each day
   and log file. To get a measure for the fluctuation in daily average of
   power development within a log file, the SD has been calculated (SD
   average: 65.3mW, range 10.4mW - 435.9mW). Discussion: The retrospective
   analysis of LVAD log files shows that power behavior is individual.
   Although most patients show a significant power difference between
   daytime and night-time hours, the maximum difference of a day and the
   average power changes over several days varies from patient to patient.
   A patient-specific power model, considering the circadian rhythm, was
   developed and applied to our thrombosis detection algorithms, which
   achieved a better thrombosis detection time of up to 93 hours compared
   to the LVAD controller alarming algorithm.
   Objectives: Suppression of membrane fouling is an important key
   technology for the development of portable and implantable artificial
   kidneys. Among several factors known to affect membrane fouling, we
   focused on the blood flow condition. In the present study, to clarify
   the effect of pulsatile and non-pulsatile blood flow on membrane
   fouling, an ex vivo hemofiltration experiment using porcine blood was
   carried out. Methods: Hemofiltration with filtrate recycling was
   performed under three conditions; pulsatile flow using a roller pump,
   non-pulsatile flow using a roller pump with three chambers to stabilize
   the flow, and non-pulsatile flow using a centrifugal pump. The blood
   flow rate (QB) was set at 50 or 100 mL/min and the maximum filtration
   rate at which irreversible membrane fouling would not occur was
   determined as follows; the first filtration rate (QF) was set at 2.5\%
   of the QB for one hour (baseline), increased by 2.5\% to 5\% of the QB
   for one hour, and then returned to the baseline value for 20 min, and
   the transmembrane pressure (TMP) was measured to check if it had
   returned to the baseline value. This step was repeated until the QF
   reached 25\% of the QB. Results: For both blood flow rates (50 and 100
   mL/min), the maximum filtration flow rate at which the TMP did not
   return to the baseline, implying that irreversible membrane fouling had
   occurred, was higher under the non-pulsatile flow conditions than under
   the pulsatile flow condition. Discussion: The flow rate and the TMP
   changed periodically under the pulsatile flow condition and the peak TMP
   value was higher than that under the non-pulsatile flow condition, which
   increases the burden on the membrane. Thus, there is an increased
   likelihood of membrane fouling, as compared to the constant the pressure
   under the non-pulsatile flow condition.
   Objectives: The objective is to develop a simulator of the anatomy and
   hemodynamics of the radial artery in order to design a robust controller
   for a noninvasive, continuous blood pressure measurement method.
   Currently, blood pressure, in intensive care units, is measured
   invasively, which can lead to complications (e.g. infections). The novel
   approach facilitates a continuous noninvasive flow measurement, in
   addition to the instantaneous blood pressure measurement. Methods:
   During measurements, a controller pneumatically adjusts the pressure in
   a balloon, positioned on top of the radial artery, so that the Doppler
   derived flow in the radial artery is reduced to a constant target value.
   The resulting pressure in the balloon correlates with the blood
   pressure. For the development of this method, a simulator, modelling the
   anatomical conditions of the lower arm, was constructed. The simulator
   was designed to create arbitrary physiological pressure curves. For the
   validation of the simulator, invasively measured blood pressure curves
   and data found in literature related to the mass flow rates were
   compared to the curves created by the simulator. Results: The pressure
   curve, created with the simulator, shows a deviation of less than 5 \%
   to the invasively measured blood pressure. The mass flow rate shows a
   good agreement with the literature data. The simulator is capable of
   simulating blood pressure curves with a mean arterial pressure of 40
   mmHg to 120 mmHg. First tests with the controller have shown that it is
   possible to control the pulsatile flow to the constant target flow rate.
   Discussion: Regarding the simulator, the next step is to adjust it, so
   that it can simulate flows above a mean pressure of 120 mmHg. Regarding
   the controller, stress tests must be conducted. It must be evaluated
   whether it is robust enough to work with pressure curves that fluctuate
   in mean pressure and frequency.
   Objectives: Relative blood volume (RBV) changes during haemodialysis are
   typically estimated from variations in haematocrit, haemoglobin or total
   blood protein measured by optical, acoustic or other sensors integrated
   in the dialysis circuit. Due to dynamic changes in the circulation
   during the initial phase of dialysis (following filling of the
   extracorporeal circuit with the patient's blood and starting dialyzer
   ultrafiltration), the indications of RBV monitors depend on the exact
   moment of starting RBV measurements. The aim of this study was to assess
   this issue quantitatively using a mathematical modelling approach.
   Methods: The developed compartmental model describes the flow of blood
   across the cardiovascular system and the extracorporeal circuit combined
   with the whole-body transport of water and the most important
   osmotically active solutes and the baroreflex mechanisms. The model was
   validated using clinical data from patients on maintenance HD. A
   standard 4-hour HD session with 3 L ultrafiltration was studied for a
   virtual reference patient with all model parameters based on the
   literature data. RBV changes were derived from the simulated haematocrit
   (HCT) changes. Two cases were analysed: the priming saline being infused
   to the patient or discarded. Results: For the case when the priming
   saline was infused to the patient, the total RBV reduction at the end of
   the simulated dialysis session varied between 8 \% (when HCT changes
   were monitored from the very beginning of dialysis) and 13 \% (when HCT
   monitoring was started circa 4 minutes later). For the case when the
   priming saline was discarded, the analogous difference in RBV reduction
   was less than 1 percentage point. Discussion: When the priming saline is
   infused to the patient, a few minute difference in the moment of
   starting RBV measurements may significantly affect the indicated RBV
   changes, which is due to the dilution of blood by the infused saline and
   the time it takes for the uniform mixing of blood across the circulatory
   system.
   We have developed autologous in vivo tissue engineered vascular grafts
   (in vivo TEVG, i.e. BIOTUBE) mainly composed of fibroblasts and collagen
   constructed in the patients' subcutaneous tissues. After long term
   animal experiments over 5 years, we clinically applied them to the
   congenital heart surgery of a 2-year-old child as a pulmonary artery
   patch plasty material in 2015. Three years after implantation, 3D-CT
   exhibited neither aneurysmal dilatation, significant calcification, nor
   shrinkage of the patch graft interfering the growth of the pulmonary
   artery. The clinical course was good without any significant
   complications over 4 years presently. However, since the tissue
   formation largely depends on the regenerative ability of the host,
   individual differences exist, and it is an issue to secure the
   mechanical reliability of the grafts formed in high-risk patients. We
   are currently evaluating the changes in mechanical properties of TEVGs
   by chemical treatment, and are examining whether it is possible to
   improve mechanical durability. In addition, in order to fabricate the
   TEVGs in healthy individuals as allogeneic (parents) or xenogeneic
   tissue substitutes, we are conducting transplantation experiments on
   decellularized tissues. The in vivo TEVGs could also be applied to
   AV-shunts. However, in the animal pilot experiments, significant
   stenosis was observed at the anastomosis with host vein resulting in
   early occlusion probably because of high sheer stresses. The attempts to
   overcome the problems by several investigators are also reviewed.
   Objectives: To evaluate different designs or insertion techniques of
   cochlear implant electrode carriers (ECs) insertion forces are measured
   by a force sensor, which is mounted directly underneath an artificial
   cochlea model (aCM) leading to a summed force profile. One of the next
   steps in CI research leads from post-experimental evaluation of measured
   insertion force profiles to pre-experimental predictions of these
   profiles using analytical models based on an improved knowledge about
   factors impacting the insertion forces. Three likely factors were chosen
   for further investigation: speed, EC stiffness and curvature of the aCM.
   Methods: Three aCM were fabricated out of PTFE blocks, each model having
   one constant curvature (r = 6.4 / 8.5 / 12.7 mm). Additionally EC
   substitutes were fabricated using a two-component silicone, all with a
   constant diameter (0.7 mm), a total length of 20.5 mm and embedded bare
   copper wires. In order to vary the stiffness of the EC substitutes, one
   type had four and the other six wires embedded. They were inserted into
   the aCM with three different insertion speeds ( v = 0.11 / 0.4 / 1.6
   mm/s). In order to increase reproducibility, insertions were conducted
   using an automated insertion test bench, comprising a linear actuator to
   clamp the EC substitutes and move them into the aCM and the force sensor
   underneath the model. Results: In accordance with theoretical
   considerations all varied factors showed effects on the insertion force
   profiles. Increased insertion speed and sample stiffness increased the
   insertion forces, whereas an increased model radius decreased the
   insertion forces. Discussion: The variance of measured forces within one
   set of parameters is due to the manual fabrication of samples and may be
   decreased by usage of commercial ECs. The influence of lubricants has to
   be analysed within future experiments.
   Objectives: The purpose of this work is to design and create a high
   efficiency inductive powering unit (IPU) for a wide range of implantable
   devices and artificial organs (AO). Methods: A possible way to realize
   wireless powering is to use inductive energy transfer systems. To
   maximize overall system efficiency class E power amplifier is widely
   used due to its 100\% efficiency in the ideal case. But maximum
   efficiency can be achieved only if input and output system parameters
   will remain constant during IPU operation. Inductive coils have nonzero
   distance between them because of patient's tissue thickness. It is worth
   noting that tissue thickness is different for every patient: the
   difference may be several millimeters. Moreover, this value can change
   during IPU operation as a result of patient's motor activity or tissue
   edema which will lead to PA detuning and decreasing efficiency. To avoid
   PA's detuning, frequency tuning systems can be used. There are two
   approaches for tuning systems that can be found in the literature. The
   first uses voltage and/or current levels of important circuit nodes to
   estimate system status. This method is good and quite simple, but
   requires external control signals that means additional power losses and
   decreased efficiency. The other method uses the phase of the voltage
   signals from important nodes and consumes less power. The second method
   was chosen by authors to design a tuning system. Results: During this
   work, a calculation method for PA and the frequency tuning system were
   designed. The experimental prototype was created. The authors of this
   article obtained an overall system efficiency of more than 60 \% for
   three different coil sets and output power from 0.7 W to 1 W for same
   coil sets and range of axial misalignments from 10 to 20 mm. Discussion:
   The high efficiency inductive powering system for AO has been designed
   and tested during this work.
   Objectives: Native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular
   access for hemodialysis (HD), but it still fails in more than 40\% cases
   within the first year. Stenosis is the main cause of AVF failure, but
   its detection and prediction are still open clinical challenges. The
   purpose of our study was to explore the potential of using sound
   analysis to reveal unique characteristics in AVF sounds and to detect
   potentially relevant changes over time. Methods: We acquired the sounds
   of 10 AVFs, 7 referred by the nephrologists as well-functioning and 3 as
   stenotic AVFs. We also acquired the sound of 1 AVF characterized by
   severe stenosis and we repeated the recording after surgical revision.
   Sounds were recorded using the Littmann Electronic Stethoscope 3200
   using wide mode. Sounds were transmitted via Bluetooth to a laptop and
   frequency spectra were obtained using an in-house Matlab code embedding
   the Fast Fourier Transform and a high-pass filter with a cutoff
   frequency of 50 Hz, aimed at attenuating stethoscope's noise and heart
   sounds' frequencies. Results: In well-functioning AVFs we consistently
   found a low-frequency peak, located in the bandwidth 100-200 Hz, while
   no relevant spectral features were present at higher frequencies. On the
   other hand, stenotic AVFs showed high-frequency peaks, located in the
   bandwidth of 500-600 Hz. In the AVF with severe stenosis we found
   high-frequency peaks in the bandwidth 700-750 Hz, which were replaced by
   low-frequency peaks after AVF revision. Discussion: Sound analysis
   revealed unique characteristics in the frequency spectra of AVFs,
   allowing an objective discrimination between well-functioning and
   stenotic AVFs. This technique may bring the advantage of limiting
   clinician's skill-dependency and personal interpretation. Despite being
   preliminary, our results suggest that sound analysis may be used to
   detect stenosis development and allow patients' self-monitoring,
   resulting in early prediction of AVF failure.
   Objectives: Biofilms on percutaneous leads of implanted blood pumps can
   cause severe infections. By treating infections with antibiotics over a
   long period of time, bacteria develop resistance. Today, in a clinical
   setting, antibiotic resistance is determined in-vitro for all available
   drugs. The aim of the EvolChip project is to predict the probabilities
   of resistances that might evolve and suggest combinations of antibiotics
   that slow down or even prevent future resistance. Methods: The EvolChip
   reactor consists of an agar plate that serves as a diffusion and growth
   medium. Three membranes permit diffusion of active substances from
   microfluidic channels into the agar medium. Two of these channels serve
   as sources for different antibiotics, the third one as the sink. As a
   result, two overlapping drug gradients establish, with a low
   concentration near the sink and high concentration close to the sources.
   Antibiotics were mixed with a nutrient solution to promote bacteria
   migration towards higher concentrated areas. The bacteria contain a
   green fluorescent protein gene, which enables real-time tracking via
   polarisation filters and a camera. Results: In preliminary experiments,
   the gradient course could be characterized by making use of fluorescent
   markers. Only resistant bacteria migrated towards the sources with high
   antibiotic concentration. The spatial distribution of bacteria
   facilitates the identification of optimal concentration ratios and
   mixtures of antibiotics. In addition, the speed of resistance evolution
   with respect to different antibiotic mixtures was determined.
   Discussion: The proposed EvolChip concept showed promising results in
   preliminary experiments. Further geometries, growth media, and bacteria
   will be tested. In order to validate the method, patient strains with
   known treatment and resistance history will be compared to the
   predictions of the presented method.
   Objectives: Due to the growing demand for organs in liver
   transplantation, techniques for optimization of suboptimal livers are
   needed such as normotermic liver perfusion (PNT). In this way, hepatic
   repercussion of ischaemic preconditioning (PI) still remains unclear.
   This study aims to analyze the haemodynamic and biochemical alterations
   produced after intraoperative PI on livers subjected to 6 hours of PNT.
   As a secondary objective, we aim to determine the effect of PI on liver
   function. Methods: Eight minipig livers, randomized to control (n=4) and
   PI group (n=4), were perfused during six hours in a PNT circuit (34oC).
   The PI group was subjected to 10 minutes of ischaemia by means of a
   Pringle manoeuvrein the hepatic hilum, followed by 10 minutes of
   reperfusion. Biochemical and gasometric parameters were measured at
   baseline and hourly in perfusate. Pressures and flows in hepatic artery
   (HA) and portal vein (PV) were registered. For statistical analysis
   Spearman's rho test and Mann-Whitney U test was performed, considering p
   < 0,05 as significant. Results: There were significant differences in HA
   flow, adjusted to weight, doubling the control group (PI 0,42 +/- 0,17
   ml/min/g Vs GC 0,17 +/- 0,05 ml/min/g; p=0,000); no differences were
   found in PV flow. Total proteins (PI 1,9 {[}1,7-2]g/dL Vs GC 1,3
   {[}0,95-1,5]g/dL; p=0,000) and O-2 consumption rate (PI 0,086
   {[}0,055-0,113] ml/min/g Vs GC 0,040 {[}0,017-0,060]ml/min/g;
   p=0,000)were significantly increased in the PI group. There were no
   significant differences in AST, ALT, or GGT. Discussion: The PI, as a
   previous maneuver to PNT, increases hepatic artery flow and O2
   consumption without altering citolytic parameters in liver. This may
   improve hepatic functionality as a previous step in transplantation.
   Further molecular and histological study should be made to clarify our
   finding in PI on PNT.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Self-help interventions have been demonstrated to be effective
   in treating bulimic-type eating disorders (EDs). In particular,
   computer-based interventions have received increasing attention due to
   their potential to reach a wider population. This systematic review
   aimed to synthesize findings from qualitative studies on users'
   experiences of self-help interventions for EDs and to develop an
   exploratory framework. Method A systematic review and meta-synthesis on
   seven peer-reviewed qualitative studies on structured computer and
   book-based self-help interventions for EDs was conducted using Noblit
   and Hare's (1988) 7-phase meta-ethnography. Four of the selected studies
   investigated computer-based self-help programs, and three of the studies
   investigated book-based guided self-help programs. Results Six concepts
   were synthesized. They included intervention-related factors (anonymity
   and privacy; accessibility and flexibility; guidance) and user-related
   factors (agency/autonomy; self-motivation; and expectations/attitudes).
   The study revealed the ``machine-like{''} and relational properties of
   the computer; the expansion of treatment time and space in psychological
   interventions, the changing role of the medical health professional from
   a ``therapist{''} to a ``guide,{''} and a change from understanding
   interventions as a conclusive treatment plan to a starting point or
   stepping stone toward recovery. Discussion Computer-based self-help
   interventions should take advantage of the ``machine-like{''} properties
   of a computer (neutrality, availability, etc.) as well as its ability to
   facilitate human interactions. Users should also be facilitated to have
   a realistic understanding of the purpose of self-help interventions and
   the place of self-help interventions in their broader treatment plans to
   moderate expectations and attitudes.}},

Abstract = {{This article aims to investigate the Grand Challenges which arise in the
   current and emerging landscape of rapid technological evolution towards
   more intelligent interactive technologies, coupled with increased and
   widened societal needs, as well as individual and collective
   expectations that HCI, as a discipline, is called upon to address. A
   perspective oriented to humane and social values is adopted, formulating
   the challenges in terms of the impact of emerging intelligent
   interactive technologies on human life both at the individual and
   societal levels. Seven Grand Challenges are identified and presented in
   this article: Human-Technology Symbiosis; Human-Environment
   Interactions; Ethics, Privacy and Security; Well-being, Health and
   Eudaimonia; Accessibility and Universal Access; Learning and Creativity;
   and Social Organization and Democracy. Although not exhaustive, they
   summarize the views and research priorities of an international
   interdisciplinary group of experts, reflecting different scientific
   perspectives, methodological approaches and application domains. Each
   identified Grand Challenge is analyzed in terms of: concept and problem
   definition; main research issues involved and state of the art; and
   associated emerging requirements. BACKGROUND This article presents the
   results of the collective effort of a group of 32 experts involved in
   the community of the Human Computer Interaction International (HCII)
   Conference series. The group's collaboration started in early 2018 with
   the collection of opinions from all group members, each asked to
   independently list and describe five HCI grand challenges. During a
   one-day meeting held on the 20th July 2018 in the context of the HCI
   International 2018 Conference in Las Vegas, USA, the identified topics
   were debated and challenges were formulated in terms of the impact of
   emerging intelligent interactive technologies on human life both at the
   individual and societal levels. Further analysis and consolidation led
   to a set of seven Grand Challenges presented herein. This activity was
   organized and supported by the HCII Conference series.}},

Abstract = {{Speech interfaces are growing in popularity. Through a review of 99
   research papers this work maps the trends, themes, findings and methods
   of empirical research on speech interfaces in the field of
   human-computer interaction (HCI). We find that studies are
   usability/theory-focused or explore wider system experiences, evaluating
   Wizard of Oz, prototypes or developed systems. Measuring task and
   interaction was common, as was using self-report questionnaires to
   measure concepts like usability and user attitudes. A thematic analysis
   of the research found that speech HCI work focuses on nine key topics:
   system speech production, design insight, modality comparison,
   experiences with interactive voice response systems, assistive
   technology and accessibility, user speech production, using speech
   technology for development, peoples' experiences with intelligent
   personal assistants and how user memory affects speech interface
   interaction. From these insights we identify gaps and challenges in
   speech research, notably taking into account technological advancements,
   the need to develop theories of speech interface interaction, grow
   critical mass in this domain, increase design work and expand research
   from single to multiple user interaction contexts so as to reflect
   current use contexts. We also highlight the need to improve measure
   reliability, validity and consistency, in the wild deployment and reduce
   barriers to building fully functional speech interfaces for research.}},

Title = {{Identifying Five Archetypes of Interaction Design Professionals and

Abstract = {{Systems and services based on Information and Communications Technology
   (ICT) are now prevalent in our daily lives. Digital transformations have
   been, and are still being, initiated across private and public sectors.
   As such, the consequences of digital exclusion are severe and may block
   access to key aspects of modern life, such as education, employment,
   consumerism and health services. In order to combat this, regions and
   countries such as the USA, Canada, EU and Scandinavia have all
   legislated universal design (UD) in relation to ICT, in order to ensure
   as many citizens as possible have the opportunity to access and use
   digital information and services. However, there has been limited
   research into how higher educational programs address legislated
   accessibility responsibilities. This paper looks into the discipline of
   interaction design (IxD). IxD is the design domain focused on `how human
   beings relate to other human beings through the mediating influence of
   products' (Buchanan, R. (2001) Designing research and the new learning.
   Des. Issues, 17, 3-23). The study presents an analysis of Norwegian
   higher educational programs within IxD. Based on document analysis, we
   map the skillsets the study programs state to deliver and investigate to
   what degree UD expertise is included. Our findings indicate the study
   programs do not deliver adequate training in UD, in order to fulfill the
   professional responsibilities related to ICT accessibility. From our
   findings, we extrapolate five `archetypes' of interaction designers.
   These personas-like analytical constructs hold slightly different
   characteristics. For each of the five, we propose UD expertise fitting
   key skillsets. We hope our contributions are useful both for the higher
   education sector and the industry and will contribute to raised
   awareness of UD skills so they can educate interaction designers in
   their different industry roles with required competences.}},

   context of office work, through the much wider, more recent, concepts of
   designing for user experience, and finally designing for high quality
   human experience. It also presents the history as well as several freely
   available resources for usability professionals outlining what usability
   is nowadays, how it can and should be measured, and criteria for
   designing to support people of all ages and abilities. Finally, it
   acknowledges Nigel's long-standing involvement in the UXPA, culminating
   in him being posthumously honored with the UXPA Lifetime Achievement
   Award in 2018.}},

Abstract = {{The study is an initial attempt to describe the mechanisms that shape
   human feelings towards hidden and difficult-to-access places in city
   parks. We studied these mechanisms by testing a 4-level model that we
   suggested. In the study, we used computer-modified photos of places in
   parks. We conducted an analysis of the correlation with Pearson's r
   coefficient and a number of analyses of the mediation effects. The
   nature of the interactions assumed in the model has been confirmed. In
   terms of the relation between the accessibility of a particular space
   and the user's preferences the following intermediaries are noted:
   first, the feeling of being out of control and then the sense of privacy
   and danger. In addition, the negative correlations between danger and
   preference are reduced when excluding the impact of privacy, and the
   positive correlations between privacy and preference are reduced when
   excluding the impact of danger. Our findings modify the idea that
   vegetation in parks should be shaped so that it does not provide hiding
   places for potential criminals. In places where the threat of crime is
   low, leaving hidden places that fulfil the need for privacy is in line
   with the users' preferences.}},

Title = {{Usability and usefulness of internet mapping platforms in participatory
   spatial planning}},
Journal = {{APPLIED GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{56-69}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Internet mapping platforms are widely used in participatory planning.
   They carry the promise of accessibility, a wider audience, and more
   precise spatial data. However, they are critiqued for issues of trust,
   digital exclusion, and low usability. While the first two problems can
   be dependent on the local context, the last one is connected with the
   introduction of map editing tools. They change browser experience and
   require accessing spatial knowledge, which is a cognitively demanding
   task, especially for older people. This can negatively influence both
   quality and quantity of the data being produced. In this paper, we ask
   questions about the perception of online forms of participation, the
   accuracy and reliability of the data being collected in participatory
   mapping, differences between participants age groups, and design
   considerations for creating successful and inclusive participatory
   mapping tools? We conducted usability testing experiment with 30
   participants. They were presented with various map editing tasks that
   were to be completed using a mock intemet participatory mapping platform
   that was designed to mimic real-life applications. The sessions were
   recorded using eye-tracking equipment.
   We have observed a considerable enthusiasm for using and interacting
   with web mapping tools, but this was not reflected in the quality of the
   data which was very low overall. Known map features were added in wrong
   places even in simpler tasks. Although there were considerable
   differences between the oldest and youngest people in the map editing
   behavior, the quality and quantity of the data were similar. We conclude
   that mapping platforms can be useful for participatory planning and age
   of the participants is not a barrier for their inclusion when the
   interface is properly designed. But in the same time care is needed to
   provide robust quality control. We also propose a research agenda
   composed from three avenues of research: data quality, usability and
   user experience and utility of the map.}},

Abstract = {{For university websites to be successful and to increase the chance of
   converting a prospective student into a current student, it is necessary
   to increase the visibility and accessibility of all related content so
   that a student can achieve their desired task in the fastest possible
   time. The criteria for evaluating university websites are very vague and
   are usually unknown to most developers, which adversely impacts the
   user-experience of the students visiting such websites. To solve this
   problem, we devised a usability metric and examined the leading
   university websites to analyze whether these websites were able to meet
   the requirements of students. In this research, we applied qualitative
   and quantitative approaches by considering 300 students and evaluating
   86 university websites (26 from Canada, 30 from the United States, and
   30 from Europe) based on a six-attribute metric comprising navigation,
   organization, ease of use (simplicity), design (layout), communication
   and content. From the evaluation results, we find that the 88\% of the
   students are satisfied with our proposed usability attributes, but that
   most universities fail to meet basic standards of usability as desired
   by the students. The findings also show that the usability evaluation
   score for each usability feature varies from country to country, such as
   for (1) multiple language support -23\% of the Canadian websites, 63\%
   of the European websites and none of the USA websites has the feature;
   for (2) Scholarships/Funding/Financial Aid link -24\% of the Canadian
   websites, 80\% of the European and the USA websites has the feature; for
   (3) admission link -88\% of the Canadian websites, 20\% of the European
   websites and 90\% of the USA websites has the feature. In addition, from
   the evaluative result we find that our proposed approach will not only
   increase the usability of academic websites but will also provide an
   easiest way to covert prospective student inquiries into enrollment
   opportunities.}},

Title = {{In silico identification of 2-oxo-1,3-thiazolidine derivatives as novel
   inhibitor candidate of class II histone deacetylase (HDAC) in cervical
   cancer treatment}},

Abstract = {{Cervical cancer ranks third among the most prevalent deadly cancer in
   women worldwide and ranks first in developing countries. It is caused by
   human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. Thus HDACs have become prominent
   inhibition target for cervical cancer treatment. In order to discover
   the new alternative HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs), we conducted a
   computer-aided drug discovery and development (CADDD) based on de novo
   approach. The compound library is based on
   4-{[}(2-oxo-1,3-thiazolidin-3-yl)carbonyl] aniline. Screening of the
   best drug leads was evaluated from several parameters, such as docking
   and interaction analysis, pharmacology, in silico preclinical trial and
   molecular dynamics analysis. The inhibitory activity of these new
   designed ligands against Homo sapiens class II HDAC was determined by
   molecular docking simulation. Docking analysis yielded eight best
   ligands which have better binding affinity than the standards.
   Therefore, interaction analysis indicated that all best ligands
   performed coordination with Zn2+ cofactor in HDAC charge-relay system
   which are essential for HDAC inhibitory activities of these inhibitors.
   Pharmacology analysis and preclinical trials of these compounds
   including pharmacology properties, bioactivity,
   mutagenicity-carcinogenicity, absorption, distribution, metabolism,
   excretion and toxicity (ADMET) properties were done through in silico
   methods. Through this analysis, the best ligands meet Lipinski's rule of
   five, have a better drug score than standards, and show good
   bioactivities, oral bioavailability and ADMET properties. All best
   ligands also have good synthetic accessibility and were proved to be new
   compounds that have never been synthesized before. Stability of
   HDAC-ligand complexes was also calculated through molecular dynamics
   (MD) simulation. Based on this simulation, complex of the best ligands
   with corresponding HDAC has a good stability based on RMSD (root mean
   square deviation) and interaction analysis. The study thus reveals eight
   best ligands (F, Ib14, O38, Kb17, Gd40, Aa50, Gc42 and Bb38) which have
   better binding affinity against human class II histone deacetylase
   (HDAC) through molecular docking, dynamics and interaction analysis. The
   best ligands were also found to have good bioactivities, oral
   bioavailability and ADMET properties through in silico pharmacology
   analysis and preclinical trial. These compounds were found to have a
   good synthetic accessibility; therefore they could be synthesized for
   further biological and clinical test. (C) 2015 The Authors. Production

Abstract = {{In this paper, we touch upon the requirement for accessibility via Sign
   Language as regards dynamic composition and exchange of new content in
   the context of natural language-based human interaction, and also the
   accessibility of web services and electronic content in written text by
   deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. In this framework, one key issue
   remains the option for composition of signed ``text{''}, along with the
   ability for the reuse of pre-existing signed ``text{''} by exploiting
   basic editing facilities similar to those available for written text
   that serve vocal language representation. An equally critical related
   issue is accessibility of vocal language text by born or early deaf
   signers, as well as the use of web-based facilities via Sign
   Language-supported interfaces, taking into account that the majority of
   native signers present limited reading skills. It is, thus, demonstrated
   how Sign Language technologies and resources may be integrated in
   human-centered applications, enabling web services and content
   accessibility in the education and an everyday communication context, in
   order to facilitate integration of signer populations in a societal
   environment that is strongly defined by smart life style conditions.
   This potential is also demonstrated by end-user-evaluation results.}},

Title = {{Dissecting a novel allosteric mechanism of cruzain: A computer-aided
   approach}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease, a neglected
   infection affecting millions of people in tropical regions. There are
   several chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of this disease, but
   most of them are highly toxic and generate resistance. Currently, the
   development of allosteric inhibitors constitutes a promising research
   field, since it can improve the accessibility to more selective and less
   toxic medicines. To date, the allosteric drugs prediction is a
   state-of-the-art topic in rational structure-based computational design.
   In this work, a simulation strategy was developed for computational
   discovery of allosteric inhibitors, and it was applied to cruzain, a
   promising target and the major cysteine protease of T. cruzi. Molecular
   dynamics simulations, binding free energy calculations and network-based
   modelling of residue interactions were combined to characterize and
   compare molecular distinctive features of the apo form and the
   cruzain-allosteric inhibitor complexes. By using geometry-based criteria
   on trajectory snapshots, we predicted two main allosteric sites suitable
   for drug targeting. The results suggest dissimilar mechanisms exerted by
   the same allosteric site when binding different potential allosteric
   inhibitors. Finally, we identified the residues involved in suboptimal
   paths linking the identified site and the orthosteric site. The present
   study constitutes the first approximation to the design of cruzain
   allosteric inhibitors and may serve for future pharmacological
   intervention. Here, no major effects on active site structure were
   observed due to compound binding (modification of distance and angles
   between catalytic residues), which indicates that allosteric regulation
   in cruzain might be mediated via alterations of its dynamical properties
   similarly to allosteric inhibition of human cathepsin K (HCatK). The
   current findings are particularly relevant for the design of allosteric
   modulators of papain-like cysteine proteases.}},

Abstract = {{As gaming acquires new purposes (for instance, entertainment, education
   and healthcare), game accessibility becomes increasingly important for
   multiple domains. For broader inclusion, game accessibility encompass
   both creation and play. Towards this goal, we have defined a framework

   present strategies resulting from developing and evaluating Lepi, an
   inclusive end-user tool for co-creation of inclusive storytelling-based
   games. Adults with heterogeneous interaction needs, levels of literacy
   and experience with computers used Lepi to co-create their games over
   ten creation workshops. Using Lepi and following the framework
   practices, the participants managed to co-create games accessible for
   themselves and their peers. From this experience, we have identified
   some strategies (Creation Commands, Interaction Alternatives for Input,
   Slots, Creation Alternatives, Assisted and Collaborative Co-Creation,
   Gentle Slopes, Multimodal Features, Playing Commands and Presenting Game
   Content) which can contribute towards more inclusive practices of game

Abstract = {{The application introduced within this paper, BCI Touch, is based on a
   prior knowledge base focused on the world of accessibility, within the
   field of information and communication technologies, EVA Facial Mouse
   application. Our main objective is to explore new paradigms of
   interaction, for the specific context of elder people with psycho-motor
   impairments. Something as routine and humdrum as the use of mobile
   devices can be an insurmountable barrier depending on the psycho-motor
   abilities of the user. Therefore, BCI Touch makes use of an innovative
   data source within the human-computer interaction field, such as
   brainwaves and brain activity patterns.
   Through the processing and adequate treatment of the bio-signals coming
   from the electroencephalography (EEG), which is recorded by the Emotiv
   Epoc+ brain-computer interface (BCI), we are able to control events that
   in turn trigger actions that facilitate interaction with the mobile
   device. BCI Touch includes a variety of possible interaction mechanisms,
   ranging from interaction by movement (cursor control with the nose
   tracker) to interaction using mental commands, passing through
   interaction through facial expressions. All these capabilities involve a
   comprehensive solution that considerably improves the technological and
   personal autonomy of elder people with Parkinson's disease (PD).}},

Abstract = {{Mental illness is rapidly gaining recognition as a serious global
   challenge. Recent human-computer interaction (HCI) research has
   investigated mental health as a domain of concern, but is yet to venture
   into the Global South, where the problem exhibits a more complex,
   intersectional nature. In this paper, we review work on mental health in
   the Global South and present a case for HCI for Development (HCI4D) to
   look at mental health-both because it is an inarguably important area of
   concern in itself, and also because it impacts the efficacy of HCI4D
   interventions in other domains. We consider the role of cultural and
   resource-based interactions towards accessibility challenges and
   continuing stigma around mental health. We also identify participants'
   mental health as a constant consideration for HCI4D and present best
   practices for measuring and incorporating it. As an example, we
   demonstrate how both the process and the lens of aspirations-based
   design, a recently proposed approach for HCI4D research and design, may
   benefit from the consideration of mental health concerns. Our paper thus
   recommends a path forward for considering mental health in HCI4D,
   potentially leading to new research directions in addition to enriching
   existing ones.}},

Abstract = {{In this day and age of identity theft, are we likely to trust machines
   more than humans for handling our personal information? We answer this
   question by invoking the concept of ``machine heuristic,{''} which is a
   rule of thumb that machines are more secure and trustworthy than humans.
   In an experiment (N = 160) that involved making airline reservations,
   users were more likely to reveal their credit card information to a
   machine agent than a human agent. We demonstrate that cues on the
   interface trigger the machine heuristic by showing that those with
   higher cognitive accessibility of the heuristic (i.e., stronger prior
   belief in the rule of thumb) were more likely than those with lower
   accessibility to disclose to a machine, but they did not differ in their
   disclosure to a human. These findings have implications for design of
   interface cues conveying machine vs. human sources of our online
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The percentage of older adults increases globally with an increased need
   for medical care. To support the idea of successful active aging,
   e-health seems to be an interesting concept. This study was conducted as
   a systematic literature study, with the aim to identify and discuss
   determinant factors in the Human computer interaction of eHealth for
   older adults. The important main research question to answer was: What
   are the critical challenges to address for an improved human computer
   interaction in technology enhanced health care systems for older adults?
   Findings show that there are several critical factors to consider, with
   trust, personal integrity, technological acceptance, e-health literacy
   and accessibility of ICT as the most determinant. If the found
   challenges are addressed, it might be possible to achieve the identified
   aim of independent living. The recommendation is a human computer
   interaction that is elderly centred, and involves the elderly users in
   the design process. However, no ICT enhanced system will be
   user-friendly enough to take away the need for social and technological
   support.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing concern to improve the accessibility of artworks
   for blind people. Much of the effort has been focused on helping the
   visually impaired people to access the exhibition facilities, but the
   works of art hosted there are still difficult to experience for them.
   Particularly, the appreciation of visual artworks is hindered as blind
   visitors are not allowed to touch them in order to conserve their
   aesthetics and value. In this work we explore our findings using a
   prototype of a voice interactive multimodal guide designed to improve
   the accessibility of visual works of arts, such as paintings, for the
   blind people. The prototype identifies tactile gestures and voice
   commands that trigger audio descriptions and sounds while a person
   explores a 2.5D tactile representation of the artwork placed on the top
   surface of the prototype. Our preliminary findings include the results
   of eight user tests and Likert-type surveys.}},

   accessibility in mobile interfaces for the elderly, considering the
   disabilities commonly acquired with age, such as reduced mobility and
   visual impairments. In this study, touch gestures, such as double tap
   and tap and hold, were analyzed to determine which gestures are
   recommended for applications aimed at elderly, and how written
   descriptions can improve their performances. Trials with a group of
   elders showed that this group performed better in interactions that used
   written descriptions instead of icons, and required longer touch
   gestures. The results suggest that implementing these factors in
   interfaces can make them more accessible to older users.}},

Abstract = {{Human-computer interaction (HCI) has developed rapidly in recent years,
   and more and more researchers are interested in applying HCI techniques
   into education. Compared with traditional approaches in the real world,
   gesture recognition is considered as a reasonable alternative since it
   is vivid and flexible. However, most of educational equipment nowadays
   achieves the function of augmented reality, without any interaction.
   This paper implemented a prototype, not only based on augmented reality
   system, but also especially we think about the interactive design.
   Accessibility is achieved by mobile devices and the dynamic switch of
   gesture recognition. By this interactive method, children are able to
   interact with the virtual objects easily and naturally. Consequently,
   children can have a profound and deep understanding of what they learn,
   and the quality of education will be improved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the role of the human-computer interface for remote, or
   online, laboratories is considered. The traditional equipment used in
   such remotely accessed laboratories is based on a desktop or laptop
   computer with keyboard, mouse and visual display unit (VDU). This is
   typical for both the client and server side computing. In recent years,
   tablet PCs (personal computers) and smart phones have enabled remote and
   mobile access using device touch screen based communications, changing
   the manner in which the user interacts with the laboratory services. The
   remote laboratory therefore needs to be set-up in order to allow for
   different user interaction (input-output) requirements. However, other
   forms of user-laboratory interaction via alternative human-computer
   interaction (HCI) devices and approaches could also be accommodated. For
   example, hand position/motion/gesture control and voice activation are
   modes of HCI that are of increasing interest, driven in many cases by
   computer gaming and home automation requirements. To illustrate an
   alternative user control of the remote experiment, this paper will
   present an example remote experiment arrangement that uses the Leap
   Motion controller for hand position, motion and gesture control of
   laboratory test and measurement equipment.}},

Abstract = {{There are now few hundred thousand healthcare apps, yet there is a gap
   in our understanding of the theoretical mechanisms for which, and how,
   technological features translate into improved healthcare outcomes. In
   particular, the technological convergence, within mobile health
   (mHealth) apps, of the processes of mass and interpersonal
   communication, and human-computer interaction requires greater parsing
   in the literature. This paper analyzed 85 empirical studies on mHealth
   apps using the Input-Mechanism-Output model. We found in the literature
   that, firstly, there is a greater emphasis on technological inputs
   (87\%) of accessibility, usability, usage, and data quality, than health
   outputs (52\%) such as system process efficiencies and individual level
   behavioral or health outcomes. Secondly, there is little evidence of
   explanatory mechanisms (19\%) of how the effects of mHealth apps are
   achieved. While we believe that successful apps would require research
   that incorporates technological inputs, theoretical mechanisms and
   health outputs, such studies are a rarity (n = 3). There is a minor
   increase in rigor with randomized control trials (n = 5), and a
   preponderance of discussion around social influence (n = 8) and
   gamification (n = 7), albeit in a scattered manner. We discuss the
   implications of the trend towards socialization and gamification
   findings in terms of future research, particularly in terms of study
   design guided by theoretical mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{With technological advancements, there has been a vast increase in the
   number of companies that fight over their market share. In search of a
   differentiating factor, companies are investing more and more in their
   products' emotional designs. This researched work has evaluated the
   affects that are caused in visually impaired people when using
   Facebook's features and then compared them with the experiences of
   sighted users. To do that, these two types of Facebook users were
   subjected to a questionnaire that was based on the PANAS affect scale.
   Once the information was collected, statistics were employed so as to
   evaluate both users' feelings. The results have shown that there were
   significant statistical differences between the sighted and the visually
   impaired users when the ``affects{''} were evaluated by using the PANAS
   tool. The five ``negative affects{''} that were selected (Irritability,
   Uselessness, Frustration, Sadness, and Confusion) were largely more
   relevant for the blind people in most of the evaluated features. This
   has indicated some serious accessibility problems. However, a high
   frequency of the five ``positive affects{''} that were considered
   (Satisfaction, Pleasantness, Surprise, Excitement, Interest, and
   Determination) were additionally observed for both of these two groups.
   These results were interpreted as feelings of both social inclusion and
   social exclusion, indicating the possibility of exploring technological
   devices that were unavailable not long ago. After analyzing their
   experiences in their usage of the Facebook features, the findings have
   also highlighted the many differing emotions that are felt by the
   visually impaired and the sighted users. The resulting outcomes have
   indicated that there are some issues that are still open to problems and
   difficulties. Moreover, these issues involve human-computer
   interactions. Nevertheless, fortunately, there is light at the end of
   the tunnel, as will be revealed.}},

Title = {{A flexible data acquisition system for storing the interactions on
   mashup user interfaces}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER STANDARDS \& INTERFACES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{10-34}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, mashups applications are growing in popularity. They are
   accessible by cross-device applications, supporting multiple forms of
   interaction in cloud environments. In general, mashups manage a huge
   amount of heterogeneous data from different sources and handle different
   kinds of users. In this respect, mashup User Interfaces are becoming one
   of the most important pieces in many kinds of current management
   systems, such as for certain geographic or environmental information
   systems working on the Internet. In this type of systems, the user
   interface plays a particular role due to the huge variety of components
   or apps that the users need to manage at the same time. However,
   currently, there has been scant attention paid to the management of the
   user's interaction with mashups interfaces. This goal involves the need
   of having important, well-constructed tools and methods conducting the
   data acquisition process for managing properly: (a) the interaction over
   the mashup user interfaces, at the front-end side; (b) the storage of
   the interaction in relational databases; and (c) well-supported
   microservices structures handled in the cloud. The fact of having
   valuable and flexible data acquisition processes encourages the
   deployment of others important issues of the interaction management,
   i.e., data searching, data mining, marketing, security, accessibility,
   usability or traceability of interaction data, among others. In this
   article, we present a flexible Data Acquisition System capable of
   capturing the human-computer interactions performed by users over mashup
   (User) Interfaces with the aim of storing them in a relational database.
   Firstly, the morphology of traditional mashup applications, their
   specifications and the relevant information that surrounds an
   interaction have been studied. Thereupon, a data acquisition system that
   stores user interaction on mashup based on such specifications was
   constructed. To achieve that purpose, an architecture of microservices
   was also designed in the cloud to detect, acquire, and collect the
   interactions performed over this kind of interfaces. The whole process
   is ready for acquiring internal data of the information system as well
   as context information and location awareness. To validate the data
   acquisition system, some tests on empirical case studies have been
   developed. Efficiency and effectiveness have also been determined by
   evaluating the performance of the acquisition system during different
   load tests. Finally, in order to ensure the software quality, a
   continuous integration strategy for software development and an easy
   management of the code have been used, facilitating the software
   maintenance alongside the microservice architecture, where
   functionalities are well encapsulated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{With continuing increases in the number of Oversize-Overweight (OSOW)

   OSOW permit program data. This framework provides an interactive,
   web-based interface to query the OSOW permit data, link OSOW records to
   geospatial data features, and dynamically visualize query results. The
   web-based interface offers scalability and broad accessibility to the
   data across different DOT divisions, and use cases. Furthermore, a user
   survey and heuristic evaluation of the interface demonstrate the

Abstract = {{Mobile devices can be an important ally that improves the quality of
   life of visually impaired people by permitting greater independence in
   the execution of certain tasks and facilitating social inclusion. This
   work presents a systematic review that maps out the accessibility issues
   that visually impaired people experience when they interact with mobile
   devices. We identified 68 accessibility problems that were mapped into
   seven problem groups. This mapping was used to propose 28
   recommendations to improve the accessibility of mobile devices. This
   analysis identified the persistence of certain accessibility problems
   such as the difficulty of typing on keyboards but also finds the
   emergence of new challenge such as the failure to recognize
   gesture-based interactions that demand more extensive training for
   users. This work is important because it provides an overview of

Title = {{Biometrics: Accessibility challenge or opportunity?}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 22}},
Abstract = {{Biometric recognition is currently implemented in several authentication
   contexts, most recently in mobile devices where it is expected to
   complement or even replace traditional authentication modalities such as
   PIN (Personal Identification Number) or passwords. The assumed
   convenience characteristics of biometrics are transparency, reliability
   and ease-of-use, however, the question of whether biometric recognition
   is as intuitive and straightforward to use is open to debate. Can
   biometric systems make some tasks easier for people with accessibility
   concerns? To investigate this question, an accessibility evaluation of a
   mobile app was conducted where test subjects withdraw money from a
   fictitious ATM (Automated Teller Machine) scenario. The biometric
   authentication mechanisms used include face, voice, and fingerprint.
   Furthermore, we employed traditional modalities of PIN and pattern in
   order to check if biometric recognition is indeed a real improvement.
   The trial test subjects within this work were people with real-life
   accessibility concerns. A group of people without accessibility concerns
   also participated, providing a baseline performance. Experimental
   results are presented concerning performance, HCI (Human-Computer
   Interaction) and accessibility, grouped according to category of
   accessibility concern. Our results reveal links between individual
   modalities and user category establishing guidelines for future
   accessible biometric products.}},

Title = {{LeadOp plus R: Structure-Based Lead Optimization With Synthetic
   Accessibility}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{We previously described a structure-based fragment hopping for lead
   optimization using a pre-docked fragment database, ``LeadOp,{''} that
   conceptually replaced `` bad{''} fragments of a ligand with ``good{''}
   fragments while leaving the core of the ligand intact thus improving the
   compound's activity. LeadOp was proven to optimize the query molecules
   and systematically developed improved analogs for each of our example
   systems. However, even with the fragment-based design from common
   building blocks, it is still a challenge for synthesis. In this work,
   ``LeadOp+R{''} was developed based on 198 classical chemical reactions
   to consider the synthetic accessibility while optimizing leads. LeadOp+R
   first allows user to identify a preserved space defined by the volume
   occupied by a fragment of the query molecule to be preserved. Then
   LeadOp+R searches for building blocks with the same preserved space as
   initial reactants and grows molecules toward the preferred
   receptor-ligand interactions according to reaction rules from reaction
   database in LeadOp+R. Multiple conformers of each intermediate product
   were considered and evaluated at each step. The conformer with the best
   group efficiency score would be selected as the initial conformer of the
   next building block until the program finished optimization for all
   selected receptor-ligand interactions. The LeadOp+R method was tested
   with two biomolecular systems: Tie-2 kinase and human 5-lipoxygenase.
   The LeadOp+R methodology was able to optimize the query molecules and
   systematically developed improved analogs for each of our example
   systems. The suggested synthetic routes for compounds proposed by
   LeadOp+R were the same as the published synthetic routes devised by the
   synthetic/organic chemists.}},

Title = {{Total Knee Replacement and the Effect of Technology on Cocreation for
   Improved Outcomes and Delivery: Qualitative Multi-Stakeholder Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: The growth in patient-centered care delivery combined with
   the rising costs of health care have perhaps not unsurprisingly been
   matched by a proliferation of patient-centered technology. This paper
   takes a multistakeholder approach to explore how digital technology can
   support the cocreation of value between patients and their care teams in
   the delivery of total knee replacement (TKR) surgery, an increasingly
   common procedure to return mobility and relieve pain for people
   suffering from osteoarthritis.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate communications and
   interactions between patients and care teams in the delivery of TKR to
   identify opportunities for digital technology to add value to TKR health
   care service by enhancing the cocreation of value.
   Methods: A multistakeholder qualitative study of user needs was
   conducted with Australian stakeholders (N=34): surgeons (n=12),
   physiotherapists (n=3), patients (n=11), and general practitioners
   (n=8). Data from focus groups and interviews were recorded, transcribed,
   and analyzed using thematic analysis.
   Results: Encounters between patients and their care teams are
   information-rich but time-poor. Results showed seven different stages of
   the TKR journey that starts with referral to a surgeon and ends with a
   postoperative review at 12 months. Each stage of the journey has
   different information and communication challenges that can be enhanced
   by digital technology. Opportunities for digital technology include
   improved waiting list management, supporting and reinforcing patient
   retention and recall of information, motivating and supporting
   rehabilitation, improving patient preparation for hospital stay, and
   reducing risks and anxiety associated with postoperative wound care.
   Conclusions: Digital technology can add value to patients' care team
   communications by enhancing information flow, assisting patient recall
   and retention of information, improving accessibility and portability of
   information, tailoring information to individual needs, and by providing
   patients with tools to engage in their own health care management. For
   care teams, digital technology can add value through early detection of
   postoperative complications, proactive surveillance of health data for
   postoperative patients and patients on waiting lists, higher compliance
   with rehabilitation programs, and reduced length of stay. Digital
   technology has the potential to improve patient satisfaction and
   outcomes, as well as potentially reduce hospital length of stay and the
   burden of disease associated with postoperative morbidity.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional forms of physical therapy and rehabilitation are often based
   on therapist observation and judgment, co-incidentally this process
   oftentimes can be inaccurate, expensive, and non-timely. Modern
   immersive Virtual Reality systems provide a unique opportunity to make
   the therapy process smarter. In this paper, we present an immersive
   virtual reality stroke rehabilitation game based on a widely accepted
   therapy method, Constraint-Induced Therapy, that was evaluated by nine
   post-stroke participants. We implement our game as a dynamically
   adapting system that can account for the user's motor abilities while
   recording real-time motion capture and behavioral data. The game also
   can be used for tele-rehabilitation, effectively allowing therapists to
   connect with the participant remotely while also having access to +90Hz
   real-time biofeedback data. Our quantitative and qualitative results
   suggest that our system is useful in increasing affordability, accuracy,
   and accessibility of post-stroke motor treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Defining qualities of developmental disabilities include deficits in
   social-emotional skills, especially with respect to emotion recognition.
   This study aims to assist adults with developmental disabilities in
   strengthening emotion recognition skills through the research and
   development of virtual reality games to increase accessibility to
   life-changing therapies. Work previously accomplished in this study
   includes the development of EmotionVR, a virtual reality game created
   for the HTC Vive. EmotionVR takes traditional methods of therapy aimed
   at teaching emotion recognition and translates it into an interesting
   and interactive narrative that provides users the opportunity to learn
   and practice emotion recognition in realistic settings. This work
   observed and analyzed the interaction between adults with developmental
   disabilities, and the HTC Vive and virtual environments. While the game
   supports the idea that virtual reality is a feasible method of providing
   such therapies, users found some discomfort with using the HTC Vive, and
   had slight difficulty translating what they had learned from the game in
   different situational contexts. To resolve those issues, we investigate
   interactions between adults with developmental disabilities and other
   virtual reality systems, and develop a 360 video based virtual reality
   game to assist with transfer of skills.}},

   focusing on the content being taught, and comparing it to national and
   international guidelines. Our results show that most professors use a
   project-centered approach in the course, balancing theory and practice.
   Semiotics and accessibility are strong influences in our context. No
   international guidelines mention any semiotic approach to HCI, although
   they are usually more detailed than national guidelines. International
   guidelines provide a list of topics together with a list of learning
   outcomes, while national guidelines are more focused on topics. We
   contribute to the HCI community by providing an analysis of the

Abstract = {{In spite of the progress made to date in the area of Human-Computer
   Interaction (HCI), recent experience reports by end users as well as
   research work have suggested that leading desktop-based Computer-Aided
   Translation (CAT) tool providers fail to consider the particular needs
   of screen reader users when developing their software. The study
   presented in this paper was conducted to assess the usability of two
   popular online CAT tools (Matecat and Memsource) that could serve as an
   alternative solution to inaccessible desktop applications. Findings
   indicate that Matecat is significantly more usable than Memsource,
   although changes would be needed in the former for blind translators to
   be able to perform a translation job completely autonomously and
   efficiently. Overall, our study suggests that accessibility awareness is
   still low in the translation technology industry, and that further
   research and development is needed in to guarantee equal opportunities
   for all in the translation market.}},

Abstract = {{An increasing importance of accessibility awareness and knowledge
   emanates from a moral imperative and as an employment differentiator. It
   is important that educational programs have a demonstrated ability to
   teach these skills. In this paper, we focus on the role that educational
   courses can play in increasing accessibility awareness for undergraduate
   students. We review literature indicating that a number of accessibility
   teaching interventions have been reported; yet the evaluation of their
   effectiveness has not been conducted in a consistent manner. We report
   on our 3-semester evaluation of undergraduate students' accessibility
   awareness and knowledge following a week of accessibility lectures as
   part of courses on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), where a subset of
   students also interact with stakeholders with disabilities during the
   conduct of the course projects. Gains in awareness and knowledge occur
   when accessibility lectures were part of the course. These gains are
   compared across the teams who interacted with a person with a disability
   and teams with no such interaction. In addition, we provide the test
   battery developed to measure these skills, to enable other researchers
   to conduct evaluations of the effectiveness of interventions for
   teaching inclusive thinking in undergraduate computing at their own
   institutions}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing trend of students going abroad to pursue their
   higher education, cross-cultural collaboration has become increasingly
   important. This study explores what considerations need to be taken into
   account when designing a pedagogical tool that helps enhance
   cross-cultural communication in a co-located context. We use a
   multi-stage approach that starts with a survey and observations to
   understand what are the key contextual aspects of cross-cultural groups.
   In the second stage, we design a technology probe Contributor, an
   interactive tabletop interface, which is deployed in a workshop
   involving university students with practical experience in Human
   Computer Interaction (HCI). Results show that key considerations when
   designing for co located cross-cultural collaboration tools in the
   context of higher education are: social accountability and visibility of
   prompts and accessibility of devices; focus on maintaining participants'
   attention to enhance conversation dynamics; focus on data privacy when
   monitoring actions of participants; and providing a platform for
   participants that allows externalization of ideas through annotations
   and visualizations, as well as highlighting keywords relevant to the
   discussion.}},

Abstract = {{The technology has become a common part of our daily lives, and the
   integration of touchscreen technology into devices is quickly becoming
   equally common. In recent years, much research has been conducted on how
   people interact with handheld devices and on different types and uses of
   touchscreen technology, but there are few studies regarding people with
   severe problems of dexterity. For this reason, the present study aims to
   understand the effect of expertize with touchscreen on the performance
   of basic touch-gestures (i.e., tapping, dragging, pinching and
   spreading) in the case of people with Systemic Sclerosis. The
   performances of a total of twelve patients with SSc, six with and six
   without previous experience with touchscreen technology, were compared
   in the study. Recommendations based on the results of this study are
   proposed to improve the accessibility of touch-screen interfaces for
   these patients.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we touch upon the requirement for accessibility via Sign
   Language as regards dynamic composition and exchange of new content in
   the context of natural language based human interaction, and also
   accessibility of web services and electronic content in written text by
   deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. In this framework, one key issue
   remains the option for composition of signed ``text{''}, along with the
   ability for reuse of pre-existing signed ``text{''} by exploiting basic
   editing facilities similar to those available for written text serving
   vocal language representation. An equally critical related issue is
   accessibility of vocal language text by born or early deaf signers, as
   well as the use of web based facilities via sign language supported
   interfaces, taking into account that the majority of native signers
   present limited reading skills. It is, thus, demonstrated how sign
   language technologies and resources may be integrated in human-centered
   applications enabling web services and content accessibility in the
   education and everyday communication context, in order to facilitate
   integration of signer populations in a societal environment that is
   strongly defined by smart life style conditions. This potential is also
   demonstrated by end user-evaluation results.}},

   assessed and categorized a set of User Experience/Human-Computer
   Interaction criteria. We examined how they organize their cognitions
   around a suggested set of 58 criteria based on 7 significant theoretical
   dimensions: accessibility, usability/practicality, emotions \&
   motivation, persuasion, cultural factors, management of the experience
   and socio-organizational factors. We aimed to determine whether the
   experts' cognitions would mirror these same theoretical considerations
   and, if so, to what extent. For this purpose, we analysed their
   classifications of the criteria during an open card-sorting task,
   limited to 7 groups. Results show a repartition of the criteria among
   the following standardized categories: (1) Utility \& Usability; (2)
   Marketing Strategy; (3) Hedonism; (4) Organizational factors; (5)
   Emotional \& Cognitive Stimulation; (6) Control \& Personalization; and
   (7) System characteristics. We found that the groups created by the
   participants were conceptually rather similar throughout their
   categorizations and that they were rather close to the founding
   theoretical dimensions we had originally considered. Implications for
   our theoretical model's architecture are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers and activists are increasingly drawing on the practice of
   collecting, archiving, and sharing stories to advance social justice,
   especially given the low cost and accessibility of digital technologies.
   These practices differ in their aims and scope yet they share a common
   conviction: that digital storytelling is empowering especially when
   curating and disseminating life stories of marginalized groups. In this
   paper, I question this conviction and ask: is it possible that such
   practices take away from what is found to be meaningful and worthwhile
   in practices of storytelling and listening, and, if so, how? To answer
   this question, I argue for a renewed attentiveness to story scenes,
   highlighting the inherently relational nature of storytelling and
   listening. I examine this relational nature through a fictional account
   that exemplifies storied encounters and demonstrates the ethical issues
   they entail through three themes-reciprocity, responsiveness, and
   communion-borne out of the plurality of philosophical positions on what
   it means to relate to another. I explain each of these themes as a
   starting point for thinking through how digital storytelling may be
   just, with implications for participatory methods in science and
   technology studies, design studies, and human-computer interaction
   inclusive of participatory design, co-design, ethnographic research, and
   participatory action research.}},

Abstract = {{Public Digital Terminals (PDT) play a vital role in providing essential
   services ubiquitously to users belonging to different target groups.
   There is a wide array of PDTs that a common person uses frequently
   including Automated Teller Machines (ATM), interactive kiosks,
   self-service kiosks and so on to accomplish numerous day-to-day tasks.
   Improving the usability of PDTs has been targeted from various aspects
   by Human Computer Interaction researchers. Research in this area has
   spanned from using multimodal approaches, revised guidelines for kiosk
   construction, navigation restructuring, to alternative methods of user
   authentication to provide an improved and enhanced user-experience. The
   main issue with the solutions provided to this day is that they all
   target improving the device. Providing a personalized solution remains
   unanswered. The widespread use of smartphones and tablets has given rise
   to the next generation of e-commerce commonly known as m-commerce.
   Although m-commerce have made huge strides in the areas of mobile
   payments, the area of making use of mobile technology with public access
   terminals is still limited. As technology edges towards cardless and
   contactless transactions, we propose to provide an accessible and
   scalable solution to the use of PDTs using proximity-aware technology.
   The main objective of the work presented in this paper is to identify
   and discuss the feasibility of using proximity-aware solutions to
   address the security, privacy and accessibility concerns when using
   PDTs.}},

Abstract = {{Existing assistive technologies often capture and utilize a single
   remaining ability to assist people with tetraplegia which is unable to
   do complex interaction efficiently. In this work, we developed a
   multimodal assistive system (MAS) to utilize multiple remaining
   abilities (speech, tongue, and head motion) sequentially or
   simultaneously to facilitate complex computer interactions such as
   scrolling, drag and drop, and typing long sentences.
   Inputs of MAS can be used to drive a wheelchair using only tongue
   motion, mouse functionalities (e.g., clicks, navigation) by combining
   the tongue and head motions. To enhance seamless interface, MAS
   processes both head and tongue motions in the headset with an average
   accuracy of 88.5\%.
   In a pilot study, a modified center-out tapping task was performed by
   four able-bodied participants to navigate cursor, using head tracking,
   click using tongue command, and text entry through speech recognition,
   respectively. The average throughput in the final round was 1.28 bits/s
   and a cursor navigation path efficiency of 68.62\%.}},

Abstract = {{While many organizations provide a website in multiple languages, few
   provide a sign-language version for deaf users, many of whom have lower
   written-language literacy. Rather than providing difficult-to-update
   videos of humans, a more practical solution would be for the
   organization to specify a script (representing the sequence of words) to
   generate a sign language animation. The challenge is we must select the
   accurate speed and timing of signs. In this work, focused on American
   Sign Language (ASL), motion-capture data recorded from humans is used to
   train machine learning models to calculate realistic timing for ASL
   animation movement, with an initial focus on inserting prosodic breaks
   (pauses), adjusting the pause durations for these pauses, and adjusting
   differentials signing rate for ASL animations based on the sentence
   syntax and other features. The methodology includes processing and
   cleaning data from an ASL corpus with motion-capture recordings,
   selecting features, and building machine learning models to predict
   where to insert pauses, length of pauses, and signing speed. The
   resulting models were evaluated using a cross-validation approach to
   train and test multiple models on various partitions of the dataset, to
   compare various learning algorithms and subsets of features. In
   addition, a user-based evaluation was conducted in which native ASL
   signers evaluated animations generated based on these models. This paper
   summarizes the motivations for this work, proposed solution, and the
   potential contribution of this work. This paper describes both completed
   work and some additional future research plans.}},

   participate. DLE are tools employed in educational institutions (from
   schools to higher education) for teaching and learning purposes, but

   asked to answer research questions via different research tools, and
   finally to rate the experience. In our first study, we compared three
   DSEs and found that not all the editions are ideal in their usability
   and that efficiency is valued more than content. In a second study, we
   pitched three different media: a printed book, a digitized edition (or
   PDF) and a digital edition of Nietzsche Also Sprach Zarathustra. We
   found that users preferred using the PDF edition due to its higher
   accessibility, portability, and annotation features. This paper
   introduces our user research and hypothesizes on the benefit and
   feasibility of developing DSE with a user requirement document.}},

Abstract = {{The human visual system processes complex scenes to focus attention on
   relevant items. However, blind people cannot visually skim for an area
   of interest. Instead, they use a combination of contextual information,
   knowledge of the spatial layout of their environment, and interactive
   scanning to find and attend to specific items. In this paper, we define
   and compare three cursor-based interactions to help blind people attend
   to items in a complex visual scene: window cursor (move their phone to
   scan), finger cursor (point their finger to read), and touch cursor
   (drag their finger on the touchscreen to explore). We conducted a user
   study with 12 participants to evaluate the three techniques on four
   tasks, and found that: window cursor worked well for locating objects on
   large surfaces, finger cursor worked well for accessing control panels,
   and touch cursor worked well for helping users understand spatial
   layouts. A combination of multiple techniques will likely be best for
   supporting a variety of everyday tasks for blind users.}},

Abstract = {{Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are involved in daily
   human activities. Accessibility guarantees that individuals with
   different abilities can interact with ICTs. User profile models are an
   explicit representation of the characteristics of an individual and are
   used to reason about what users need. They are implemented through
   ontologies. After identifying common and different aspects among
   important ontologies in the domain of accessibility and e-inclusion, we
   designed and implemented the ACCESIBILITIC ontology applying the NeOn
   methodology, specifically by reusing and reengineering these ontologies.
   The strengths of our model include the user's ability to develop a high
   variety of activities despite his/her disabilities, support for
   inference processes, and providing answers to several competency
   questions. ACCESIBILITIC allows the representation of suitable technical
   support based on the user's capabilities when interacting with ICTs. To
   this end, we use an activity-centered design (ACD), which allows us to
   identify daily activities and to match these activities with a suitable
   technology to perform them.}},

Abstract = {{The widespread accessibility of the Internet offers a convenient way to
   deliver the learning content. This research study aims to improve the
   interactivity and stimulation for an on-line learning community. The
   main objective of this paper is to propose, build, and evaluate a
   framework for collaborative human-computer interaction in e-learning.
   The proposed framework utilizes the social cognitive development
   theories for building five levels, which represent the analysis,
   requirements and characteristics for enhancing the collaborative
   e-learning (CEL) process. Based on these levels, the CEL model is
   divided into six tasks which serve as technical visibility to build a
   solid social learning platform. According to these tasks, the proposed
   framework is implemented and equipped with five major collaborative
   modules that represent a web-based student-centred CEL environment. The
   proposed CEL model has been evaluated in terms of computer supported
   collaborative learning and on an adaptable usability of heuristic
   checklist for on-line courses by using student activity data and
   questionnaire analysis. Results have shown that the CEL can be adopted
   to support student education, promote teamwork and increasing student
   motivation within e-learning environments.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Information seeking is an interactive behaviour of the end users
   with information systems, which occurs in a real environment known as
   context. Context affects information-seeking behaviour in many different
   ways. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors that
   potentially constitute the context of visual information seeking.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors used a Straussian version of
   grounded theory, a qualitative approach, to conduct the study. Using a
   purposive sampling method, 28 subjects participated in the study. The
   data were analysed using open, axial and selective coding in MAXQDA
   software.
   Findings The contextual factors influencing visual information seeking
   were classified into seven categories, including: user characteristics,
   general search features, visual search features, display of results,
   accessibility of results, task type and environmental factors.
   Practical/implications This study contributes to a better understanding
   of how people conduct searches in and interact with visual search
   interfaces. Results have important implications for the designers of
   information retrieval systems.
   Originality/value This paper is among the pioneer studies investigating
   contextual factors influencing information seeking in visual information
   retrieval systems.}},

Abstract = {{Eye tracking allows psychologists to make broad distinctions between
   groups of participants. Therefore, it may be entirely possible to
   exploit these distinctions in order to create screening tools for
   potentially diagnosing various conditions. These diagnostic techniques
   may have a number of advantages over exiting techniques. However, in
   order to develop such screening tools it would be beneficial if eye
   tracking systems were easy to access and use. There are a number of ways
   to improve accessibility of eye trackers: affordability, transportation,
   ease of use. This positional paper explores how HCI (Human Computer
   Interaction) eye trackers can be used for diagnostic purposes of

Abstract = {{Websites that are usable and accessible can have a positive impact on
   the overall user experience. Usability Inspection Methods (UIMs) can be
   applied to evaluate and measure the usability. The current research in
   the fields of Web Accessibility and Human -Computer Interaction (HCI) is
   in need of additional UIMs that can be applied to also measure the
   accessibility, in addition to the usability alone. In this article, a
   novel UIM in the form of a heuristic evaluation is presented. The
   heuristic evaluation aims to support HCI experts and Web developers in
   designing and evaluating websites that provide positive user experiences
   to users who are deaf. This article discusses the development of the
   Heuristic Evaluation for Deaf Web User Experience (HE4DWUX). Following
   an iteration cycle, version 2 of the HE4DWUX is presented in Appendix A.
   An existing three-phase process to develop heuristics for specific
   application domains was applied to construct the HE4DWUX. The outcome of
   this research is 12 heuristics, with each containing its own set of
   checklist items to operationalize its applicability in measuring the Web
   user experience for users who are deaf. The heuristics and their
   checklist items can identify important aspects of design that will
   impact the Web user experience for this particular user group.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile devices can be used as assistive technologies as they help
   improve the quality of life of people with visual impairments (PVI).
   Despite the advantages of mobile devices, it is necessary to overcome
   some challenges regarding the difficulties of interacting of these users
   with the operating system of these devices. This is important for the
   use of this technology to reach a greater number of the visually
   impaired. Therefore, this study aimed to perform an interface design and
   the development of an application. It automatically adapts the Android
   (R) operating system according to the accessibility preferences of the
   visually impaired through voice commands. These preferences were
   validated in previous studies. With the help of computational tools and
   tests with PVI, it was possible to create the prototype of the
   application interface and to know the improvements to be made. The
   developed application showed potential to be a useful tool for the
   visually impaired, also bringing specific benefits of using the voice
   command to partially impaired people.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The influence of digitalisation on service experiences requires new
   capabilities from customers. In particular, the computer-mediated
   interaction affects customers' perceived accessibility into
   self-services. Thus, we posed the following research question: ``How
   does an individual's ability to use a computer influence the need for
   direct person-to-person interaction in services?{''} The study is based
   on a postal survey conducted in south-eastern Finland. Data were
   collected using a random sample of N = 3000 people ranging from 60 to 90
   years of age. A total of 1121 valid responses were received. The data
   were slightly biased towards respondents who are coping well. We
   employed structural equation modelling with a multi-group moderation
   approach in the analysis.
   The findings indicate that satisfaction is related to routines in the
   service process. Customers' ability to perform the requisite role in the
   service process influences their preference for human interaction.
   Interestingly, the value of human interaction is driven by customers'
   expected abilities, whereas physical restrictions have a minor
   influence. We contribute to the literature explaining co-creation in
   computer-mediated services by applying human behaviour models to assess
   the customers' value expectations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Information technology-supported tourism services and platforms have
   made it easier for individual travelers to plan and manage their trips.
   But with smart tourism, a number of human-computer interaction issues,
   such as the decision support in the context of tourists' information
   processing, have surfaced. This study investigates the impact of the
   important smart tourism technology (STT) characteristics on travel
   decision support satisfaction and the moderating effects of
   self-efficacy on the main relationships. We adopted the elaboration
   likelihood model as an overarching theory to develop our hypotheses that
   revolve around both the central route and peripheral routes in the
   elaborated process, and tested the model with survey data collected from
   South Korea. The findings illustrate that SIT characteristics of
   information quality, source credibility, interactivity, and
   accessibility have a positive influence on travel decision support
   satisfaction. Self-efficacy toward STT use was found to have a positive
   moderating impact on a hypothesized central route but negative
   moderating influence on three peripheral routes. Theoretical
   contributions and managerial implications of this study are discussed.

Abstract = {{In this work, we show how our open source accessibility software, the
   FaceSwitch, can help motor-impaired subjects to efficiently interact
   with a computer hands-free. The FaceSwitch enhances gaze interaction
   with video-based face gestures interaction. The emerging multimodal
   system allows for interaction with a user interface by means of gaze
   pointing for target selection and facial gestures for target-specific
   action commands. The FaceSwitch maps facial gestures to specific mouse
   or keyboard events such as: left mouse click, right mouse click, or page
   scroll down. Hence, facial gestures serve the purpose of mechanical
   switches. With this multimodal interaction paradigm, the user gazes at
   the object in the user interface with which it wants to interact and
   then triggers a target-specific action by performing a face gesture.
   Through a rigorous user study, we have obtained quantitative evidence
   that suggests our proposed interaction paradigm improves the performance
   of traditional accessibility options, such as gaze-only interaction or
   gaze with a single mechanical switch interaction while coming close in
   terms of speed and accuracy with traditional mouse-based interaction.
   Wemake the FaceSwitch software freely available to the community so the
   output of our research can help the target audience.}},

Abstract = {{Higher and further education providers are facing the challenge of
   supporting the interaction needs of an increasing number of students who
   feature accessibility preferences to use both elearning contents and
   services. In the next future, we can expect that, within adaptive
   elearning systems, both automatic and manual procedures will
   interoperate to elicit users' interaction needs for ensuring
   accessibility. In this paper, we report findings from the user
   experience with the self-assessment of interaction needs, as part of a
   content personalization system, which tackles possible mismatches in the
   interaction between the user and the learning objects. All stakeholders
   involved in providing this service along with intended user groups
   (students with visual, auditory or mobility impairments, and without
   impairments) participated in the evaluation with over 100 users
   described in this paper. From the evaluation, results follow that our
   approach allows students to self-assess and report adequately their
   interaction preferences. Furthermore, the paper describes findings of
   interest and open issues about how massive online courses may address
   the accessibility needs of an increasing number of elearning users.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, researchers have attempted to shift patient decision
   aids (PDAs) from paper-based to web-based to increase its accessibility.
   Insulin decision aids help diabetes patients, most of whom are elderly
   to make an informed decision to start insulin. However, the lack of
   usability guidelines applicable for such target group causes developers
   to struggle to answer the challenging question `How can such web service
   be made usable, and, ultimately, acceptable and accessible for elderly
   patients?'. Hence, the purpose of this study is to identify the common
   usability requirements that may facilitate good practices to empower
   elderly diabetes patients in utilizing a web-based insulin decision aid
   for their benefit. We set out an approach to use prototyping and
   retrospective think-aloud techniques to explore web usability barriers
   that elderly patients may encounter when using an insulin decision aid
   web site and use the feedback for improving the prototype. Usability
   requirements were captured iteratively through scoping, brainstorming,
   prototype, testing and evaluating. The study suggests that the insights
   from experts and users are equally important to assure the validity of
   the identified usability guidelines; they reflect the accessibility
   needs of the aging community while complementing the key requirements of
   an insulin decision aid. The study contributes to recommend web
   usability guidelines backed by a series of expert and user evaluations
   which could be a proactive resource to improve usability, acceptability
   and accessibility of online insulin decision aids for elderly with
   diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{Tactile icons were proposed to convey non-visual information as an
   abstract approach. Perception of transformational Tactons has been
   explored, which encode two or more dimensions of information with
   various vibrotactile parameters. Unlike transformational Tactons,
   compound Tactons are a sequence of two or more one-element Tactons.
   However, little has been done on how to design compound Tactons to
   present non-visual information effectively. This article investigates
   mean recognition rates and information transfer values of compound
   Tactons that encode complex navigation information, and evaluates their
   effectiveness on assisting the participants to navigate in a virtual
   city. Results of the experiments indicate that overall identification
   rate for three-parameter Tactons is 92.7\% by manipulating different
   vibrotactile parameters, and 88.7\% for four-parameter Tactons by adding
   an extra thermal parameter; guided by these compound Tactons, all
   participants were able to reach destinations in the simple virtual urban
   environment. Therefore, compound tactile icons can be a potential way of
   conveying multidimensional information.}},

Abstract = {{Human-centered computing is rapidly becoming a major research direction
   as new developments in sensor technology make it increasingly feasible
   to obtain signals from human beings. At the same time, the pervasiveness
   of computing devices is also encouraging more research in human-computer
   interaction, especially in the direction of personalized and adaptive
   user interfaces. Among the various research issues, affective computing,
   or the ability of computers to understand and react according to what a
   user ``feels,{''} has been gaining in importance. In order to recognize
   the human affect (feeling), computers rely on the analysis of signal
   inputs captured by a multitude of means. This paper proposes the use of
   human physiological signals as a new form of modality in determining
   human affects, in a non-intrusive manner. The principle of
   non-invasiveness is very important, since it imposes no extra burden on
   the user, which improves user accessibility and encourages user
   adoption. This goal is realized via the physiological mouse, as a first
   step toward the support of affective computing. The conventional mouse
   is converted with a small optical component for capturing user
   photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal. With the PPG signal, it is possible
   to compute and derive human physiological signals. A prototype of the
   physiological mouse was built and raw PPG readings measured. The
   accuracy of the approach was evaluated through empirical studies to
   determine human physiological signals from the mouse PPG data. Finally,
   pilot experiments to correlate human physiological signals with various
   modes of human-computer interaction, namely gaming and video watching,
   were conducted. The trend in physiological signals could be used as
   feedback to the computer system which in turn adapts to the needs or the
   mood of the user, for instance change the volume and the light intensity
   when watching a video or playing a game based on current user emotion.
   The authors argue that this research will provide a new dimension for
   multimodal affective computing research, and the pilot study has already
   shed some light toward this research goal.}},

Abstract = {{Quadriplegic people are unable to use mobile devices without the aid of
   other persons which can be devastating for them both socially and
   economically. This has motivated many researchers to propose hardware
   and software solutions that operate as intermediates between the
   impaired users and their devices: accessibility switches, joysticks and
   head movements. However, the efficiency of these tools is limited in
   some conditions. To alleviate this problem, we propose to exploit
   electroencephalographic signals captured via an adequate headset. More
   precisely, the user is asked to perform a facial expression that will be
   recognized by the system through the analysis of the EEG signals.
   Several facial expressions are offered and each one corresponds to a
   command wirelessly sent to the mobile device and executed. This Brain
   Computer Interface based system is called SmileToPhone. It enables the
   quadriplegic patients to use their smartphones in an easy way with a
   minimum of effort and with respect to studied Human-Computer-Interaction
   requirements. The system includes the main functionalities of a
   smartphone such as making calls and sending messages. The evaluation of
   the system usability showed that most of the time, users were able to
   use the different functionalities of the system in an easy way. The
   current results are encouraging and motivating to add more features to
   the system.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of universal design (UD) is growing from its devised domain
   of accessibility, thus becoming a stimulating research topic reaching
   further beyond the field of human/computer interaction. An inspiring
   characteristic of the universally designed end product and its value to

   factors of that quality are yet to be fully learned by the practice and
   application of UD. One way to resolve this problem is to expand the UD
   research toward interdisciplinary practice. In this paper, the status of
   UD and its relationship to sustainability in terms of its possibility
   and perspective with interdisciplinary research are analyzed. A
   framework unfolds which explains and argues how interdisciplinary
   research could help UD advance toward the aim of sustainability. The
   proposed theoretical framework would open new research opportunities to

   test was done with five visually impaired students. They were asked to
   think aloud while performing 11 tasks involving their university's web
   pages, including the main page and the pages of student affairs, library
   and departments and then to accomplish these tasks. In this test, five
   tasks were not successfully completed by all students. According to the
   test results, finding final exam dates on the academic calendar posed
   major difficulties, and accessing the course schedule web page was the
   task that required the most time. The test results indicated the need
   for a search engine on each page, a text version for all pages,
   rearrangement of the web link sequences with tabs and more information
   about visuals. Suggestions related to the visually impaired students'
   needs were offered.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel strategy to implement a CAPTCHA (Completely
   Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart). The
   aim of these tests is to easily and reliably distinguish between real
   human users and (malicious) bots. The approach underlying FATCHA is to
   exploit real time capture of human actions instead of human ability to
   recognize visual or auditory items. The latter approach explicitly
   requires proposing a challenge difficult for an automatic responder but
   easy for a human. However, it is often the case that pursuing the first
   feature takes to lose the second one. Moreover the user task may be
   hindered by specific disabilities. According to FATCHA approach the
   system rather asks the user to carry out some trivial gesture, e.g.,
   rotating or moving the head. The webcam, which is available in almost
   all computers or mobile devices, captures the user gesture, and the
   server (hosting the service to protect) matches it with the requested
   one. It is possible to extend the service with a second module that
   allows the user to authenticate himself by face recognition instead of
   using a password. On the contrary, FATCHA gesture challenge can be used
   as a liveliness test to avoid biometric spoofing. Multimodal interaction
   is the base for both an advanced Human Interactive Proof (HIP) test and
   for robust/comfortable authentication.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile technologies provide radical opportunities in the domain of
   Assistive Technologies (AT) for persons with disabilities and the
   elderly by facilitating them to access multimedia content and improve
   their social interaction. The search for mobile AT applications that
   meet specific user needs is not an easy task for the disabled users,
   their facilitators, and rehabilitation professionals, as the mobile app
   stores do not include a category for AT or a classification by
   disability. In this work, we first provide an analysis of the disabled
   users' needs along with the required mobile software adaptations in
   order to fulfill them. Then, we introduce a methodological approach for
   the design and development of web-based inventories which make the
   search and selection of AT apps simpler and efficient. This methodology
   has to main parts, first it is based on experts in an AT lab thoroughly
   testing each application, and second, the creation of a consistent and
   well-documented presentation of the information for each app. Finally,
   we present the mATHENA repository of free AT apps for mobile devices
   (smartphones and tablets), which has been created by following the
   suggested methodology for creating AT app inventories. Currently,
   mATHENA includes 420 free mobile AT applications, carefully selected
   from a total of 1100. The features of mATHENA are compared with the
   functionality and social interaction services of six other inventories
   for AT applications.}},

Abstract = {{Touchscreen technologies have become increasingly common in personal
   devices, so it seems necessary to improve their accessibility and
   usability for the older people. In the past years, a lot of studies have
   been conducted to improve touch interfaces, however, most them do not
   consider older people with very low attitude with ICTs. Moreover, the
   majority of studies date back 2014, so they lack to consider the most
   innovative technologies available today. The present study involves a
   sample of older people without previous experience with ICTs with the
   aim of analyzing how basic features of a touchscreen interface affect
   their performances with typical touch-gestures. A total of 22
   participants have been involved. Results partially confirm the existent
   literature and partially reveal new interesting findings that can be
   useful to improve the touch screen accessibility for older people.}},

Abstract = {{Whilst usability has been the most prominent user interface property in
   early Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research other properties such as
   accessibility, inclusive design, user experience and, more recently
   security, trust and resilience (among many others) might also be
   important for the development of interactive system. It is interesting
   to notice that user interface properties might overlap and sometimes
   create conflicting recommendations. A good example is security which, by
   recommending users to deal with passwords reduces system usability by
   placing a burden on users. The ultimate goal of this workshop is to
   promote the investigation of multiple user interface properties in a
   user-centered design process. We are concerned by theories, methods and
   approaches for dealing with multiple user interface properties when
   developing interactive system. This workshop is organized by the IFIP WG
   13.2 on Human-Centered Software Methodologies and the WG 13.5 on
   Resilience, Reliability, Safety and Human Error in System Development.}},

Abstract = {{The visual impaired are a specific minority group that can benefit from
   specific assistive systems in order to mitigate their mobility and
   accessibility constrains. In the last decade, our research group has
   been integrating and developing assistive technologies, focused in
   human-computer interaction, artificial vision, assisted navigation,
   pervasive computing, among others. Several projects and prototypes have
   been developed with the main objective of improving the blind's
   autonomy, mobility, and quality of life. Currently the technology has
   reached a maturation point that allows the development of systems based
   on video capturing, image recognition and location referencing, which
   are key for providing features of artificial vision, assisted navigation
   and spatial perception. The miniaturization of electronics can be used
   to create devices such as electronic canes that equipped with sensors
   can provide so much more contextual information to a blind user. The
   adoption of these systems is dependent of an information catalogue
   regarding points of interest and their physical location reference. In
   this paper we describe the current work on assistive systems for the
   blind and propose a new perspective on using the base information of
   those systems to provide new services to the general public. By bridging
   the gap between the two groups, we expect to further advance the
   development of the current systems and contribute to their economic
   sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{eLearning can provide people with Intellectual Disability (ID) extended
   learning opportunities in using information technology, thus potentially
   increasing digital inclusion. In order to make this a motivating
   experience, designs of eLearning are required to be compatible with
   their cognitive abilities. It is as yet unclear how to design an
   engaging eLearning environment that integrates usability with learning.
   This paper aims to explore the applicability of learning theories along
   with usability guidelines in designing an eLearning environment for
   people with ID. We discuss psychological theories on teaching and
   learning, and literature on challenges and opportunities of eLearning
   for people with ID. Based on that understanding, we present guidelines
   that integrate different learning theories with eLearning, for learner
   centered interaction design of eLearning modules for people with ID. We
   present a case study of applying these inclusive design considerations
   to an eLearning module about health information access.}},

Abstract = {{Human-Computer interfaces play a key role in the design of information
   System, as they link the system with its end-users, allowing information
   exchange and improving communication. Nowadays, applications
   increasingly become various and complex, they aim at multiple,
   heterogeneous and dynamic contexts of use examined according three
   facets: the end-users of the interactive system, the platform with which
   users have to perform their interactive tasks and the physical
   environment where they are interacting Nevertheless, users no longer
   wish to adapt themselves to this heterogeneity of the interaction
   situations; they yet want their systems to be adapted. Thus, with regard
   to the requirements to which the multiplicity of technologies is added,
   providing User interfaces (Ins) with adaptation capabilities is becoming
   more and more an important issue. We address these issues by proposing a
   Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach for semi-automatic generation of
   context-dependent UIs based on a Business Rules Management System (BRMS)
   as an adaptation engine. Our approach is supported by a conceptual
   framework and a graphical tool for modeling context situations, editing
   adaptation rules and launching the adaptation process.}},

Abstract = {{Universal Design (UD) is an approach to promoting an inclusive society
   with equity as a central focus. With trends in globalization and
   population aging, it is critical to cultivate a UD-oriented mindset
   among younger people who will be responsible for promoting a more
   democratic and sustainable society. However, the challenge remains to
   convince students in higher education of the importance of UD. One
   potential reason is the common misunderstanding that UD is only
   dedicated to persons with disabilities, and thus, possibly due to the
   social stigma associated with disability, students deem UD irrelevant in
   many cases. Another potential reason is an unfamiliarity with the
   principles associated with UD as well as situations where they
   experience any inability or discomfort using a nonuniversally designed
   product, service or environment. On the other hand, human/user-centred
   design (UCD) is supported by the ISO standard 9241-210: 2010 and has
   been more widely recognized as a fundamental approach to successful
   design and development of a product, especially in the field of
   human-computer interaction. The lack of a UD-oriented mindset may
   unconsciously limit the image of ``users{''} within their knowledge, and
   hence the potential diversity in user traits or use situations could be
   neglected. In other words, if the students experience UD as beneficial
   for themselves, it could provide a useful basis for recognizing the
   importance and impact of UD. By taking two international student
   projects as cases, this study retrospectively discusses how such tactics
   may effectively cultivate a UD mindset among graduate-level students.}},

Abstract = {{The area of Human Computer-Interaction (HCI) contributes significantly
   to the success or failure of an interactive application. However,
   sometimes this discipline does not have the importance that it should
   have in higher education. Nevertheless, its importance is gaining
   attention in the establishment of bodies of knowledge for Information
   and Communication Technologies (ICT).
   The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) defines Human
   Computer-Interaction (HCI), as ``a discipline concerned with the design,
   evaluation an implementation of interactive computing systems for human
   use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them{''}. It
   requires an understanding of the importance of the user in the
   development of ICT applications and systems, and it implies the
   development of a mentality that recognizes the importance of users,
   their work practices and organizational contexts. Topics covered in this
   discipline may include methodologies of user-centered design,
   interaction design, ergonomics, accessibility norms and cognitive
   psychology. This article presents a first analysis of the skills and
   competences demanded in relation to the Human Computer discipline in the
   context of the European e-Competence Framework (e-CF). In addition, we
   have carried out a study about the development of these competences in

   is a data structure encapsulating different representations of the same

   reducing manual effort during data integration process.
   We evaluate our algorithms on a large-scale Web tables corpus having

Abstract = {{Accessibility is an integral element of Human Computer Interaction (HCI)
   domain which deals with building the tools in the digital ecosystem that
   shall be used universally by all categories of users irrespective of
   their disabilities. For persons with disabilities the security in the
   digital environments acquires increased significance as they are one
   among the leading soft targets. Phishing is an active cyber security
   issue which is based on both technical and social engineering
   components. A wide variety of Anti-Phishing tool have been developed to
   detect phishing sites. In Phishing the attackers target internet users
   for providing important credentials by sending fraudulent emails with
   links to a site which is visually similar to its legitimate counterpart.
   Anti-phishing tools help users for combating these frauds but from the
   accessibility perspective there are still barriers for persons with
   visual impairments. The major objective of this paper is to provide an
   insight into these accessibility barriers in the interface of
   Anti-Phishing browser extensions for persons with visual impairments.
   The scope of this study is in the accessibility dimension and hence the
   core anti-phishing methodology adopted by these tools are not elaborated
   in detail. With the outcome of this accessibility analysis study of
   these anti-phishing tools, potential suggestions are also listed out in

Abstract = {{Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by core deficits in
   imagination and communication, which impairs the individual's ability
   for effective interaction and socialization. Since these children learn
   effectively through imagery, educational set ups often use them for
   imparting education to this target group. However, conventional
   education settings use one-on-one interactions for long durations making
   accessibility to these specialized settings difficult. This is due to
   the high cost and restricted availability of specialized resources. With
   technological advancement, investigators have been exploring alternate
   approaches like, human robot interaction and human computer interaction
   (HCI). In this present work, we have used HCI to design various tasks
   that have relevance to social and non-social components of
   communication. While our participants interacted with HCI tasks, we
   acquired their real-time physiological signal. Results of an
   experimental study with a small group of ASD and their age-matched
   typically developing counterparts were promising with variations in
   their performance and psycho-physiology.}},

   behaviour and eye movements on Search Engine Results Page (SERP) between
   two different cultures (Arabic and English), using the eye-tracking
   method in order to provide insights for global implementations of search
   engines. This research also aims to explore to what extent users with a
   different language and cultural background differ in their visual search
   behaviour, performance and satisfaction when they are searching SERP
   with different layout and tasks. As a preliminary study, a controlled
   eye-tracking experiment was conducted to explore and evaluate the visual
   search behaviour of Arabs and English when searching through the Google

Abstract = {{Purpose - Strokes are the most common cause of long-term disability of
   adults in developed countries. Continuous participation in
   rehabilitation can alleviate some of the consequences, and support
   recovery of stroke patients. However, physical rehabilitation requires
   commitment to tedious exercise routines over lengthy periods of time,
   which often cause patients to dropout of this form of therapy. In this
   context, game-based stroke rehabilitation has the potential to address
   two important barriers: accessibility of rehabilitation, and patient
   motivation. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper provides a review of design
   efforts in human-computer interaction (HCI) and gaming research to
   support stroke rehabilitation.
   Findings - Based on extensive review, this paper highlights challenges
   and opportunities in this area, and discusses an architecture guideline
   for a game-based stroke rehabilitation system.
   Originality/value - This study was an original study.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we explore our role and ethical obligations as

   from any one code of ethics (COE), we analyze across COEs offered by the
   professional associations related to our team's research backgrounds to
   develop a framework for exploring ethical dilemmas in HCI research.
   While the individual COE tended to be overly specific and prescriptive,
   our framework highlights common concerns, applicable to a broad range of
   contexts. We then apply this framework to reflect on two ethical
   dilemmas, we faced during our work with hospice patients and their
   families. Through this exercise, we demonstrate how the framework can be
   applied to ethical dilemmas in HCI research.}},

Title = {{Trends and challenges of visual search interfaces in digital libraries
   and repositories}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONIC LIBRARY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{69-98}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to present an overview of the challenges
   encountered in integrating visual search interfaces into digital
   libraries and repositories. These challenges come in various forms,
   including information visualisation, the use of knowledge organisation
   systems and metadata quality. The main purpose of this study is the
   identification of criteria for the evaluation and integration of visual
   search interfaces, proposing guidelines and recommendations to improve
   information retrieval tasks with emphasis on the education-al context.
   Design/methodology/approach - The information included in this study was
   collected based on a systematic literature review approach. The main
   information sources were explored in several digital libraries,
   including Science Direct, Scopus, ACM and IEEE, and include journal
   articles, conference proceedings, books, European project reports and
   deliverables and PhD theses published in an electronic format. A total
   of 142 studies comprised the review.
   Findings - There are several issues that authors did not fully discuss
   in this literature review study; more specific, aspects associated with
   access of digital resources in digital libraries and repositories based
   on human computer interaction, i. e. usability and learnability of user
   interfaces; design of a suitable navigation method of search based on
   simple knowledge organisation schemes; and the use of usefulness of
   visual search interfaces to locate relevant resources.
   Research limitations/implications - The main steps for carrying out a
   systematic review are drawn from health care; this methodology is not
   commonly used in fields such as digital libraries and repositories. The
   authors aimed to apply the fundamentals of the systematic literature
   review methodology considering the context of this study. Additionally,
   there are several aspects of accessibility that were not considered in
   the study, such as accessibility to content for disabled people as
   defined by ISO/IEC 40500: 2012.
   Originality/value - No other systematic literature reviews have been
   conducted in this field. The research presents an in-depth analysis of
   the criteria associated with searching and navigation methods based on
   the systematic literature review approach. The analysis is relevant for
   researchers in the field of digital library and repository creation in
   that it may direct them to considerations in designing and implementing
   visual search interfaces based on the use of information visualisation.}},

   multimodal components for developing accessible applications and it is
   discussed lessons learned from its use in the development and evaluation
   of applications using that scheme. This scheme has already been used to
   guide the development of two software tools, both aimed at improving

Abstract = {{The present document assesses the impact of learning cognitive disorders
   on accessing online resources. This paper relates to Human Factor and
   Systems Interaction since it covers the wider social concerns leading to
   improved access to computers and system by currently disadvantaged
   groups in this paper focuses on people with cognitive learning
   disorders. This is a thought exercise study and examines how technology,
   represented by online resources, is made available without
   discriminating against those with learning cognitive disorders. The
   learning impact has been assessed by the Human Factors based methods of
   Soft Systems Methodology (SSM), Usability Engineering (UE) and Ontology
   Sketch Modelling (OSM). The major finding of the study is that whilst
   there are tools that make access to many resources more equitable, there
   is still limited understanding of how those with cognitive disorders
   assimilate information. In addressing this aspect, the present document
   has examined the wider role of semantic web technology that by
   introducing codification of context and pragmatics can improve the
   presentation of knowledge such that those with cognitive learning
   disorders can achieve non-discriminatory access to online resources. The
   aim of this paper is to consider how online resources are presented to
   ensure that irrespective of the level of cognitive impairment the
   semantic value of resources is conveyed equally to all users. From this
   study, a few key lessons were learned from examining the impact of
   learning cognitive disorder on accessing online resources. The impact
   can be minimal since guidelines and web standards if followed ensure
   sites and systems have adequate accessibility and usability design or
   built into the interfaces from the beginning. Also, it could be argued
   for greater built-in support to allow for less reliance on 3rd party aid
   tools since while that would give benefit to users with cognitive
   learning disorders it would also benefit all users since it is natural
   to take advantage of tools which can benefit the overall work process.
   Finally, a future study should cover a more in-depth assessment which
   could involve a blind test of tasks with a mixture of people with and
   without learning disabilities to ensure a more in-depth examination of
   the impact of learning cognitive disorders on accessing online
   resources.}},

Abstract = {{Interacting with ridesharing systems is a complex spatiotemporal task.
   Traditional approaches rely on the full disclosure of a client's trip
   information to perform ride matching. However during poor service
   conditions of low supply or high demand, this requirement may mean that
   a client cannot find any ride matching their intentions. To address this
   within real-world road networks, we extend our map-based opportunistic
   client user interface concept, i.e., launch pads, from a discrete to a
   continuous space-time representation of vehicle accessibility to provide
   a client with a more realistic choice set. To examine this extension
   under different conditions, we conduct two computational experiments.
   First, we extend our previous investigation into the effects of varying
   vehicle flexibility and population size on launch pads and a client's
   probability of pick-up, describing the increased opportunity. Second,
   observing launch pads within a real-world road network, we analyze
   aspects of choice and propose necessary architecture improvements. The
   communication of ride share potential using launch pads provides a
   client with a simple yet flexible means of interfacing with on-demand
   transportation.}},

Abstract = {{The developments and improvements in human-computer interaction and
   information and communication technologies have resulted in innovative
   assistive technology (AT) solutions for the people with disabilities
   (PWDs). Although, there have been many new ideas and technologies for
   assisting the PWDs, still very few of them have considered the workplace
   environment. Therefore, there is a need to develop a comprehensive
   universal AT solution that can maximize the PWDs productivity at work.
   In this work, an AT and smart context-aware solution has been developed
   to assist the PWDs at the workplace. This has been achieved through the
   designing and the implementation of a smart unified interface to guide
   and assist the PWDs. A wireless sensor network has been employed in this
   context-aware smart solution in order to track and determine user's
   location. The unified interface is adaptive and includes four modules
   that are smart helping, smart communication, smart editor, and auto
   emergency response. A proper AT process and technological design
   considerations have been adopted to achieve a comprehensive, universal,
   adaptive, and context-aware solution.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an accessible interactive surface specifically
   designed for cerebral palsy users. The work context is an educational
   centre for disabled users, although the system presented can be used in
   other contexts. The main contributions are as follows: the table leaves
   enough leg room to fit in wheelchairs and has a half-circle radius
   cut-out in the top which lets users in wheelchairs sit closer to the
   tabletop. Table height can be easily adjusted to children or adults. The
   tabletop screen angle can be easily adjusted to adapt to different body
   postures and allow for user comfort. The tabletop does not compromise
   user safety as the surface is protected with strong Plexiglas.
   Furthermore, an assessment of accessibility has been carried out to
   analyse its appropriateness to fit users with different characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of the present work is to investigate the potential acceptance
   of a set of web interaction aids by older adults, in order to help them
   overcome difficulties associated with ageing and help them continue
   using the web as a source of information, communication and services.
   This paper presents a survey with older adults concerning their
   perceptions about a set of web interaction aids defined after a field
   observation study, a study with questionnaires and user tests of web
   applications. The survey involved 313 participants, of which about 44 \%
   were older adults and elderly users. The results showed that the use of
   aids to support the interaction of older adults with the web promotes
   improvements in the interaction of older adults and younger users alike,
   which supports the argument for enhanced universal usability. Finally,
   it was possible to diagnose barriers that still remain and which aids
   had best acceptance by older adults.}},

Abstract = {{We have recently reported G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) model
   structures for the active and inactive states of the human dopamine D2
   receptor (D2R) using adrenergic crystal structures as templates. Since
   the therapeutic concentrations of dopamine agonists that suppress the
   release of prolactin are the same as those that act at the high affinity
   state of the D2 receptor (D2High), D2High in the anterior pituitary
   gland is considered to be the functional state of the receptor. In
   addition, the therapeutic concentrations of anti-Parkinson drugs are
   also related to the dissociation constants in the D2High form of the
   receptor. The discrimination between the high- and low-affinity (D2Low)
   components of the D2R is not obvious and requires advanced
   computer-assisted structural biology investigations: Therefore, in this
   work, the derived D2High and D2Low receptor models (GPCR monomer and
   dimer three-dimensional structures) are used as drug-binding targets to
   investigate binding interactions of dopamine and apomorphine. The study
   reveals a match between the experimental dissociation constants of
   dopamine and apomorphine at their high- and low-affinity sites of the D2
   receptor in monomer and dimer and their calculated dissociation
   constants. The allosteric receptor receptor interaction for dopamine D2R
   dimer is associated with the accessibility of adjacent residues of
   transmembrane region 4. The measured negative cooperativity between
   agonist ligand at dopamine D2 receptor is also correctly predicted using
   the D2R homodimerization model.}},

Abstract = {{Engagement theory posits that students in the classroom can be fully
   engaged and motivated in learning when a technology is being used for
   them to find information and knowledge to solve a problem, or to
   complete an assignment, and by so doing they can understand better the
   meanings and relationships of concepts involved. Today in developed and
   developing countries, the information communication technology (ICT) and
   the internet are the powerful medium that can promote engagement in
   learning. Concurrently, the ICT and internet are so readily accessible
   via the use of mobile digital devices such as smartphones, iphones,
   ipads, and laptops. The ICT and internet applications on mobiledigital
   devices also have somewhat altered pedagogy, from non-engagement to
   engagement via computer mediated learning, virtual interactive learning,
   and collaborative learning. Furthermore, according to socialization
   theory, mobile digital devices with internet and various applications
   can be the new medium for widening social networking albeit virtually
   among high school and college students.
   The purpose of this paper is to highlight the phenomenon of easy
   accessibility to smartphones and internet, which can make learning more
   constructive and effective for the new generation of digital-age
   children and youth ( or digital natives). The accessibility of the
   mobile device has its advantages in terms of the ubiquitous application
   of collaborative mobile learning in both the informal setting as well as
   the formal classroom situation. The context, the software application
   used and the available hardware related to mobile technology influence
   the concept of mobile learning.
   Relevant literature on this topic has been reviewed. Research has shown
   the advantages of collaborative mobile learning in increasing students'
   motivation, engagement, and interaction in the classroom, and to develop
   critical thinking skills. However, the implementation of mobile learning
   has several implications on the curriculum such as the need for
   proficiency in English, the development of resources for mobile
   learning, the availability of the necessary hardwares in schools, and
   the recruitment of human resources for maintaining and supporting
   learning for mobile learning environments.}},

Abstract = {{We begin with the premise that data literacy is a fundamental facet of
   citizen education in this information age, and that an engaged citizenry
   in a democracy not only requires access to data, but also the capacity
   to manipulate and examine the data from multiple perspectives. The
   visualization of data elucidates trends and patterns in the phenomena
   that the data represents, and opens accessibility to understanding
   complicated human and natural processes represented by data sets.
   Research indicates that interacting with a visualization amplifies
   cognition and analysis. A single visualization may show only one facet
   of the data. To examine the data from multiple perspectives, engaged
   citizens need to be able to construct their own visualizations from a
   data set. Many tools for data visualization have responded to this need,
   allowing non-data experts to manipulate and gain insights into their
   data, but most of these tools are restricted to the computer screen,
   keyboard, and mouse. Cognition and analysis may be strengthened even
   more through embodied interaction with data. We present here the
   rationale for the design of a tool that allows users to probe a data
   set, through interactions with graspable (tangible) three-dimensional
   objects, rather than through a keyboard and mouse interaction. We argue
   that the use of tangibles facilitates understanding abstract concepts,
   and facilitates many concrete learning scenarios. Another advantage of
   using tangibles over screen-based tools is that they foster
   collaboration, which can promote a productive working and learning
   environment. We speculate that collaborative data exploration can be a
   productive educational activity for citizens in their communities and in
   the classroom, and we suggest our tool as a means to do this.}},

Abstract = {{Tabletop systems support simultaneous multi-user multi-touch interaction
   to select and manipulate digital contents such as text, images, and
   videos directly and in a natural way. These digital contents require the
   proper orientation to perform co-located collaborative tasks. To achieve
   this, some orientation techniques are also proposed in different
   domains. But, the orientation issue is still reported for collaborative
   medical image analysis around tabletop systems. The presence of the
   inappropriate digital content-orientation on tabletop displays limits
   the collaborative medical image analysis. It also decreases the
   visibility, accessibility and readability of digital contents during
   co-located collaborative interaction. This paper presents a user study
   to evaluate usability of the two different orientation techniques for
   diagnosing and monitoring of medical images from the user perspective.
   Subsequently, the comparative analysis of those techniques is presented
   and discussed based on the obtained data. The findings suggest that the
   manual-orientation technique provide better usability as compared to the
   global-orientation technique for diagnosing and monitoring the medical
   images. Finally, the future work is suggested based on the obtained
   findings to enhance the usability.}},

   develop human-computer interfaces that increase the quality of life and
   e-inclusion of the disabled or aged people. Thus, was developed an
   EMG-based computer access device that use biological signals. Another
   device for computer access was developed based on inertial sensors,
   which allow capturing motion. From the Fitts' law test carried out, it

Abstract = {{In the case of driving informational systems, techniques can be used to
   improve user experience in an automotive context, especially regarding
   proactive systems. Heuristic inspection techniques are classical methods
   to assess interfaces aspects and identify problematic components for
   human computer interactions. This paper deals with the problem of the
   integration of four sets of criteria which are (1) Accessibility
   (Perceptibility, Temporal Adaptation, Simplicity, Comprehensibility,
   Robustness); (2) Practicality (Guidance, Workload, Explicit Control,
   Adaptability, Error management, Consistency, Significance of codes,
   Compatibility); (3) Emotionality (Degree of control, Challenge, Degree
   of Independence, Fantasy, Trust, Sensorial interest, Cognitive interest,
   Effort, Satisfaction), and (4) Persuasiveness (Credibility, Privacy,
   Personalization, Attractiveness, Solicitation, Priming, Commitment,
   Ascendency). It shows that criteria are complementary between each other
   to identify main ergonomic problems but it also highlights the need to
   consider further aspects for heuristic inspection of a driving

Abstract = {{We developed a web-based experiment platform for psychological
   experiments and questionnaire surveys to evaluate accessibility,
   especially for elderly participant studies. Our proposing system is an
   accessible experiment platform for experimenters and participants, which
   has necessary and sufficient functions for studies to solve many open
   questions of aging society, especially for evaluating accessible design.
   This system has three advantages. (1) No programming knowledge is needed
   for users. This system makes surveys and experiments possible only by
   inputting essential values and words such as a sentence of question, a
   file name of image to present, a numerical value of presentation time.
   (2) The System requirements are less severe than other systems. The user
   can run experiments on a PC, tablet, or mobile, without installing any
   specific software. If the study does not require strict control of
   environmental conditions, elderly people can join the survey at home or
   anyplace. Moreover, this system enables studies for elderly people
   without a lot of costs, since it is web-based and does not need to have
   many licenses. (3) Our proposing system has essential functions for
   basic psychological experiments. It is compatible with personal
   information protection, confirmation of written consent, design of the
   task procedure (randomize, block, shuffle), input and response (e.g.,
   free description, evaluation axis, selection, coordinates of mouse
   click, and response time). The proposing experiment platform is useable
   for the accessibility study to fill in the gap of digital divide,
   especially the studies of human computer interaction in aging society.}},

Abstract = {{Computer games have great potential both for learning purposes and to
   overcome cognitive disabilities such as dyslexia, but many games are
   unnecessarily inaccessible by design for many gamers. There are few
   games accessible for people with cognitive impairments and cognition is
   also less researched regarding game accessibility. This gap is
   especially problematic when using games in educational contexts; both
   regarding universal human rights of education and equality but also
   because understanding content is central in a learning situation.
   Furthermore, game based learning projects often have very limited
   budgets, restraining to what extent game content can be adapted by the
   developers. However, computer games are increasingly required to be
   accessible due to legislation in the USA, which will benefit all gamers
   to different degrees. The problem is that adapting content usually
   requires human intervention and extra resources, which are limited for
   all game developers but especially so for GBL developers and independent
   entertainment game developers. Involving the game community could be a
   possible approach for many developers, but how community driven
   adaptation of text based content for cognitive accessibility could be
   achieved is not a trivial question. A possible approach to close the gap
   in a sustainable way is a community driven adaption of content such as
   transforming text into a simplified form, while maintaining meaning of
   the text and keeping the game balanced. This interdisciplinary,
   theoretical study discusses these issues based upon academic papers in
   computer games, learning, social psychology, linguistics, biology, human
   computer interaction and accessibility. The findings explain what
   simplified text is and what it means in the context of games, as well as
   how game balance can be achieved in different approaches of games and
   learning. Furthermore, the findings are discussed regarding motivations
   for the game community for contributing with simplified texts, and how
   to create accessible interfaces for selecting the highest-rated
   simplified texts. Concluding remarks are that community based adaptation
   can be preferred to or be used in conjunction with automated and/or
   individual solutions. Also, how to design a ranking system for
   acknowledging authors is discussed as well as what social psychology
   techniques can be used to increase user participation. Handling abuse of
   the system is important, as well as considering different challenges for
   different forms of games (real-time/turn-based,
   multi-player/single-player) and different approaches to games and
   learning. Finally, future work with participatory action research and
   potential benefits for people with other disabilities is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The use of mobile applications to assist with healthcare management is
   becoming increasingly present today. Healthcare consumers are demanding
   technologies that promote self-directed healthcare management;
   additionally, healthcare practitioners are utilizing these technologies
   to share ownership of healthcare responsibility. One aspect of
   healthcare that is common is the process of medical transition. Medical
   transition is when an individual shifts from a pediatric to adult
   healthcare team. As an individual's medical history becomes more
   complex, often due to a chronic medical condition, the medical
   transition process is often complicated. To address this, a mobile
   application was designed and developed to assist patients undergoing
   medical transition. This paper extends previous work by presenting the
   results of the first round of usability testing on the mobile
   application.}},

   these maps with auditory However, commonly these approaches focus on
   blind people. We present an approach which incorporates visually
   impaired people by visually augmenting relevant parts of tactile maps.
   These audiovisual tactile maps can be used in conjunction with common
   tablet computers and smartphones. By integrating conductive elements
   into 3D printed tactile maps, they can be recognized by a single touch
   on the mobile device's display, which eases the handling for blind and
   visually impaired people. allow multiple elevation levels in our
   transparent tactile maps, we conducted a study to reconcile technical
   and physiological requirements of off-the-shelf 3D printers, capacitive
   touch inputs the human tactile sense. We propose an interaction concept
   for 3D printed audiovisual tactile maps, verify its feasibility and test
   it with a user study. Our discussion includes economic considerations
   crucial for a broad dissemination of tactile maps for both blind and

Abstract = {{In recent years, Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have been steadily
   gaining ground in the market, used either as an implicit or explicit
   input method in computers for accessibility, entertainment or
   rehabilitation. Past research in BCI has heavily neglected the human
   aspect in the loop, focusing mostly in the machine layer. Further, due
   to the high cost of current BCI systems, many studies rely on low-cost
   and low-quality equipment with difficulties to provide significant
   advancements in physiological computing. Open-Source projects are
   offered as alternatives to expensive medical equipment. Nevertheless,
   the effectiveness of such systems over their cost is still unclear, and
   whether they can deliver the same level of experience as their more
   expensive counterparts. In this paper, we demonstrate that effective BCI
   interaction in a Motor-Imagery BCI paradigm can be accomplished without
   requiring high-end/high-cost devices, by analyzing and comparing EEG
   systems ranging from open source devices to medically certified systems.}},

Abstract = {{Internet offers a huge amount of services related to government,
   entertainment, and communication. However, to ensure that any citizen
   can have proper access to all services and information, it is necessary
   to think about accessibility in a broader way than it is found in the
   Web. Universal Design points to a way of thinking about the
   heterogeneity of capabilities instead of segregating according to
   individual disabilities. In the Web, applying this approach involves
   solving the challenge of selecting the appropriate content modality, at
   the appropriate time. Thus, this work present a study focusing on
   selecting the modality of a Web content based on the data resulting from
   a single pageview, minimizing efforts related to profile filling or
   explicit customization of Web systems. The study involved the analysis
   of 261 sessions, 31 coming from people that informed being using
   assistive technology. From the experiment performed it was possible to
   identify that the algorithm Random Committee provided the best results
   for the studied problem (precision 94.8\%; recall of 94.3\%). Results
   are potentially of interest for Human-Computer Interaction practitioners
   aiming at providing adequate content modality after minimum usage.}},

Abstract = {{It is argued that traditional accessibility standards have a
   content-centric perspective and proposes, in response, a communicative
   approach of e-Accessibility where the interface is a mean of
   communication and action. The communicative approach finds its
   theoretical foundations in significant models from the Human Computer
   Interaction field; particularly in those that adopted Semiotics and
   Activity Theory as a basis for studying interface design. Its
   originality lies in integrating the discursive dimension to the
   accessibility model. A portal that offers massive open online courses
   (MOOC) is taken as a case study. Considering the accessible design
   solutions proposed for this particular case study, a comparison between
   the content-centric perspective and the communicative approach is made
   in order to show that the latter can complement the former in pursuit
   for a more complete communicative accessibility.}},

Abstract = {{In today's democratic society, the notion that all citizens have equal
   opportunity to express their views and opinions and right to information
   irrespective of any disability are elementary principles. The Web is
   becoming the centerpiece of this new information age. However, web sites
   are prone to accessibility issues and in some way or the other are
   inaccessible to people with disabilities. This paper provides a useful
   touchstone for those developers who have been standing at the shores of
   designing accessible web sites and even for those who have taken a deep
   dive in web designing in making Web accessible to all. This paper
   presents development of a validating and analysis tool to rate a web
   site on accessibility checkpoints by W3C (WCAG 2.0). Efforts are made in
   attaining web accessibility using web scrapping as a technology. Paper
   also contains tightly bound relations between various HTML attributes

Abstract = {{The computer industry is getting advanced. In a short span of years,
   industry is growing high with advanced techniques. Robots have been
   replacing humans, increasing the efficiency, accessibility and accuracy
   of the system and creating man-machine interaction. Robotic industry is
   developing many new trends. However, they still need to be controlled by
   humans itself This paper presents an approach to control a motor like a
   robot with hand gestures not by old ways like buttons or physical
   devices. Controlling robots with hand gestures is very popular
   now-a-days. Currently, at this level, gesture features are applied for
   detecting and tracking the hand in real time. A principal component
   analysis algorithm is being used for identification of a hand gesture by
   using open CV image processing library. Contours, convex-hull, and
   convexity defects are the gesture features. PCA is a statistical
   approach used for reducing the number of variables in hand recognition.
   While extracting the most relevant information (feature) contained in
   the images (hand). After detecting and recognizing hand a servo motor is
   being controlled, which uses hand gesture as an input device (like mouse
   and keyboard), and reduces human efforts.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of age on
   visuomotor tracking using submental and anterior neck surface
   electromyography (sEMG) to assess feasibility of computer control via
   neck musculature, which allows people with little remaining motor
   function to interact with computers. Thirty-two healthy adults
   participated: 16 younger adults aged 18-29 years and 16 older adults
   aged 69-85 years. Participants modulated sEMG to achieve targets
   presented at different amplitudes using real-time visual feedback. Root
   mean squared (RMS) error was used to quantify tracking performance. RMS
   error was increased for older adults relative to younger adults. Older
   adults demonstrated more RMS error than younger adults as a function of
   increasing target amplitude. The differential effects of age found on
   static tracking performance in anterior neck musculature suggest more
   difficult translation of human-computer interfaces controlled using
   anterior neck musculature for static tasks to older populations.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Recent studies have revealed that large numbers of
   non-coding RNAs are transcribed in humans, but only a few of them have
   been identified with their functions. Identification of the interaction
   target RNAs of the non-coding RNAs is an important step in predicting
   their functions. The current experimental methods to identify RNA-RNA
   interactions, however, are not fast enough to apply to a whole human
   transcriptome. Therefore, computational predictions of RNA-RNA
   interactions are desirable, but this is a challenging task due to the
   huge computational costs involved.
   Results: Here, we report comprehensive predictions of the interaction
   targets of lncRNAs in a whole human transcriptome for the first time. To
   achieve this, we developed an integrated pipeline for predicting RNA-RNA
   interactions on the K computer, which is one of the fastest
   super-computers in the world. Comparisons with experimentally-validated
   lncRNA-RNA interactions support the quality of the predictions.
   Additionally, we have developed a database that catalogs the predicted
   lncRNA-RNA interactions to provide fundamental information about the
   targets of lncRNAs.}},

Abstract = {{Interaction plays a fundamental role as it sets bridges between humans
   and computers. However, people with disability are prevented to use
   computers by the ordinary means, due to physical or intellectual
   impairments. Thus, the human-computer interaction (HCI) research area
   has been developing solutions to improve the technological accessibility
   of impaired people, by enhancing computers and similar devices with the
   necessary means to attend to the different disabilities, thereby
   contributing to reduce digital exclusion.
   Within the aforementioned scope, this paper presents an interaction
   solution for upper limb amputees, supported on a myographic
   gesture-control device named Myo. This device is an emergent wearable
   technology, which consists in a muscle-sensitive bracelet. It transmits
   myographic and inertial data, susceptible of being converted into
   actions for interaction purposes (e.g. clicking or moving a mouse
   cursor).
   Although being a gesture control armband, Myo can also be used in the
   legs, as was ascertained through some preliminary tests with users. Both
   data types (myographic and inertial) remain to be transmitted and are
   available to be converted into gestures. A general architecture, a use
   case diagram and the two main functional modules specification are
   presented. These will guide the future implementation of the proposed
   Myo-based HCI solution, which is intended to be a solid contribution for
   the interaction between upper limb amputees and computers. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Multimodal human-computer interaction refers to the interaction with the
   virtual and physical environment through natural modes of communication.
   Multimodal input user interfaces have significant role in different
   domains, for example industrial plants or hospitals, also they have
   implications for accessibility. To develop multimodal applications in
   formally rigorous settings, software developer teams may use tools or a
   software development kit to increase the efficiency and the quality of
   the resulted software artifacts. Such a technique is performing the
   design with software modeling and applying model transformations to
   generate well-defined components of the software. Furthermore,
   representation-bridging communication is a discipline of cognitive
   infocommunications, where the sensory information transferred to the
   receiver entity is filtered and/or converted. Whenever such approaches
   are used, the challenges associated with the modeling of information
   requirements, user capabilities and cross-model interactions are
   compounded and further increase the need for formal design and
   verification tools. Applying model transformations is a way to support
   this activity. Communication-intensive solutions often require complex
   methods, i.e. significant model transformation efforts between the
   different representations. Important semantic information should be
   preserved and not misinterpreted in a complex model transformations.
   Therefore, methods are required to verify that the semantics used during
   the application generation and analysis are indeed preserved across the
   transformation. As a case in point, such a model transformation could
   yield embedded code for a given type of electronic driver assistant
   system based on a high-level characterizations of the information to be
   transferred and the driver's cognitive capabilities. Later, a multimodal
   interactions expert could easily modify those characterizations on
   demand, and regenerate a modified version of the software without having
   to know about the low-level details of the embedded platform. This paper
   provides a strong motivation regarding the necessity of methods to
   support verification and validation of model transformations supporting
   multimodal application development and cognitive infocommunications. As
   the main result of the paper, we compile a list of open issues in the
   field of verification/validation of model transformations, and link
   those issues to the development of multimodal interfaces. Through its
   discussions, the paper makes the point that the design practices behind
   multimodal interfaces could strongly benefit from the use of formal
   modeling techniques in general, and model transformation approaches in
   particular.}},

Title = {{An Interactive Computer Session to Initiate Physical Activity in
   Sedentary Cardiac Patients: Randomized Controlled Trial}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: Physical activity (PA) improves many facets of health.
   Despite this, the majority of American adults are insufficiently active.
   Adults who visit a physician complaining of chest pain and related
   cardiovascular symptoms are often referred for further testing. However,
   when this testing does not reveal an underlying disease or pathology,
   patients typically receive no additional standard care services. A PA
   intervention delivered within the clinic setting may be an effective
   strategy for improving the health of this population at a time when they
   may be motivated to take preventive action.
   Objective: Our aim was to determine the effectiveness of a tailored,
   computer-based, interactive personal action planning session to initiate
   PA among a group of sedentary cardiac patients following exercise
   treadmill testing (ETT).
   Methods: This study was part of a larger 2x2 randomized controlled trial
   to determine the impact of environmental and social-cognitive
   intervention approaches on the initiation and maintenance of weekly PA
   for patients post ETT. Participants who were referred to an ETT center
   but had a negative-test (ie, stress tests results indicated no apparent
   cardiac issues) were randomized to one of four treatment arms: (1)
   increased environmental accessibility to PA resources via the provision
   of a free voucher to a fitness facility in close proximity to their home
   or workplace (ENV), (2) a tailored social cognitive intervention (SC)
   using a ``5 As{''}-based (ask, advise, assess, assist, and arrange)
   personal action planning tool, (3) combined intervention of both ENV and
   SC approaches (COMBO), or (4) a matched contact nutrition control (CON).
   Each intervention was delivered using a computer-based interactive
   session. A general linear model for repeated measures was conducted with
   change in PA behavior from baseline to 1-month post interactive computer
   session as the primary outcome.
   Results: Sedentary participants (n=452; 34.7\% participation rate)
   without a gym membership (mean age 58.57 years; 59\% female, 78\% white,
   12\% black, 11\% Hispanic) completed a baseline assessment and an
   interactive computer session. PA increased across the study sample
   (F-1,F-441= 30.03, P<.001). However, a time by condition interaction
   (F-3,F-441= 8.33, P<. 001) followed by post hoc analyses indicated that
   SC participants exhibited a significant increase in weekly PA
   participation (mean 45.1, SD 10.2) compared to CON (mean -2.5, SD 10.8,
   P=.004) and ENV (mean 8.3, SD 8.1, P<. 05). Additionally, COMBO
   participants exhibited a significant increase in weekly PA participation
   (mean 53.4, SD 8.9) compared to CON (P<.001) and ENV (P=.003)
   participants. There were no significant differences between ENV and CON
   or between SC and COMBO.
   Conclusions: A brief, computer-based, interactive personal action
   planning session may be an effective tool to initiate PA within a health
   care setting, in particular as part of the ETT system.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, because of the undeniable impact of the Internet on all
   aspects of human life, security preserving has received more attention.
   To reach an acceptable level of security, Completely Automatic Public
   Turing test to tell Computer and Human Apart or simply CAPTCHA as a
   security preserving tool has been tailored for situations that need to
   prevent bots from doing a specific action; for example, signing up and
   downloading. Simultaneously, it should be also designed in such a way to
   allow humans to perform the same action. Despite its advantageous
   applications, there are several important issues such as security,
   usability, and accessibility that make its use controversial. In this
   paper, attempts were made to do a comprehensive review on various
   aspects and state-of-the-art of CAPTCHA in general and its alternatives
   in particular to help researchers easily focus on specific issues for
   the sake of proposing new solutions and ideas. Regarding the advancement
   in CAPTCHA development, new classifications were proposed to categorize
   different variations of CAPTCHAs and their problems and then compare
   them. Moreover, different types of CAPTCHAs' alternatives were
   classified and evaluated by introducing several proposed measures. This
   evaluation could come in handy for future studies that aim to develop
   new techniques for overcoming current deficiencies. Copyright (c) 2014

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to present a non-exhaustive set of 36 design
   patterns for interactive social applications used by older adults. This
   proposal represents a reliable starting point for designers/developers
   to easily incorporate usability in interfaces for said technology
   promoting technology acceptance, use and adoption among older adults.
   The proposed patterns were based on previous efforts commonly presented
   as a design criteria and guidelines to describe usability issues in this
   kind of interfaces, reinforcing those alternatives by specifying related
   usability issues and providing solutions in a pattern-fashion useful for
   designers/developers. Pertinence of the patterns was analyzed through a
   usability study implementing ``heuristic evaluation{''} technique
   (frequently used in Human-Computer Interaction to obtain users'
   perception on a particular design). The study was conducted from two
   perspectives: the vantage point from experts, and the perception of a
   social group of older adults. The analysis revealed the proposed
   patterns are conducive to create well-designed interfaces able to
   provide a better user experience, encouraging a positive impact in the
   quality of life in older adults.}},

Abstract = {{Although Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) often improve usability,
   individuals with physical disabilities may be unable to use a mouse and
   keyboard to navigate through a GUI-based application. In such
   situations, a Vocal User Interface (VUI) may be a viable alternative.
   Existing vocal tools (e.g., Vocal Joystick) can be integrated into
   software applications; however, integrating an assistive technology into
   a legacy application may require tedious and manual adaptation.
   Furthermore, the challenges are deeper for an application whose GUI
   changes dynamically (e.g., based on the context of the program) and
   evolves with each new application release. This paper provides a
   discussion of challenges observed while mapping a GUI to a VUI. The
   context of the authors' examples and evaluation are taken from Myna,
   which is the VUI that is mapped to the Scratch programming environment.
   Initial user studies on the effectiveness of Myna are also presented in
   the paper.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{One mode of creative design is for designers to draw analogies that
   connect the design domain (e.g., a mechanical device) to some other
   domain from which inspiration is drawn (e.g., a biological system). The
   identification and application of analogies can be supported by software
   tools that store, structure, present, or propose source domain stimuli
   from which such analogies might be constructed. For these tools to be
   effective and not impact the design process in negative ways, they must
   fit well with the information and interaction needs of their users.
   However, the user requirements for these tools are seldom explicitly
   discussed. Furthermore, the literature that supports the identification
   of such requirements is distributed across a number of different
   domains, including those that address analogical design (especially
   biomimetics), creativity support tools, and human-computer interaction.
   The requirements that these literatures propose can be divided into
   those that relate to the information content that the tools provide
   (e.g., level of abstraction or mode of representation) and those that
   relate to the interaction qualities that the tools support (e.g.,
   accessibility or shareability). Examining the relationships between
   these requirements suggests that tool developers should focus on
   satisfying the key requirements of open-endedness and accessibility
   while managing the conflicts between the other requirements. Attention
   to these requirements and the relationships between them promises to
   yield analogical design support tools that better permit designers to
   identify and apply source information in their creative work.}},

   improving the accessibility of classical music concert performances by
   enhancing and enriching them in novel multimodal ways. This requires a
   user-centered approach throughout the project. After introducing the
   project, we discuss its goals, the technological challenges it offers,
   and current scientific and technological outcomes. Subsequently, we
   discuss how integrated prototypes combine several technological advances
   in the project into coherent user-ready interfaces, offering novel ways
   to experience the timeline of a concert, and rediscover and
   re-experience it afterwards. Finally, we discuss how PHENICX outcomes
   have been demonstrated live in concert halls.}},

Abstract = {{The use of haptic technologies has great advantages, as it can offer
   realistic and intuitive interaction with virtual objects, increase the
   usability and accessibility of applications, improve end-users'
   cognitive and perceptual capabilities and also make the human-computer
   interaction more entertaining. Currently, there are many haptic toolkits
   available. However, existing haptic toolkits are too complex and do not
   directly support adding haptic feedback in web applications. Moreover,
   some of the existing toolkits have been developed by companies that sell
   haptic devices supporting, thus, only their devices. This paper presents
   the P4A Haptic Toolkit developed in the context of the Prosperity4All
   FP7 project that enables adding haptic feedback to web applications by
   also supporting a variety of the most common existing haptic devices.
   Through this toolkit, a 3D scene containing virtual objects with haptic
   feedback can be easily integrated in a web application requiring almost
   no programming skills. Haptic feedback in web applications can
   significantly improve end-users' cognitive capabilities, especially in
   cases of visually impaired users.}},

Abstract = {{Assistive technologies need to be affordable, ergonomic and easy to use.
   In this work we argue that smartwatches could be assistive devices for
   the visually impaired, if they have the potential to run complex
   applications. Hence, in this paper we propose a face recognition system
   to show that it's technically possible to develop a real-time computer
   vision system in a wearable device with limited hardware, since such
   systems generally require powerful hardware. A case study is presented
   using the first generation Samsung Galaxy Gear smartwatch. The system
   runs only on the watch's hardware and consists in a face detection and
   recognition software that emits an audio feedback so that visually
   impaired users know who is around them. The case study includes an
   evaluation of the proposal with users. Results are shown and discussed
   validating the technological aspects of the proposal and pointing out
   room for improving the aspects of interaction.}},

Abstract = {{In spite of recent improvements in non-visual web access, images on the
   web still present an accessibility barrier to screen reader users. For
   this population group the presence of inappropriate text alternatives
   for images, or simply their absence, usually results in a poor web user
   experience. In this paper, we propose a controlled language (CL)
   rule-based approach that enables translation professionals to ensure
   image accessibility during the web localisation process. We describe the
   set of 40 CL rules we developed and then present the results of the
   evaluation of a selection of ten rules from the set. During the study,
   which sought to assess their impact on the appropriateness of text
   alternatives in French, the ten rules were applied using Acrolinx, a
   state-of-the-art CL checker. The results of the evaluation suggest that
   this sub-set of ten rules can help translators significantly improve the
   level of image accessibility obtained in the localised web product.}},

Abstract = {{Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) is a key topic on the Accessibility
   area, namely in what concerns a Smart-City environment, where humans
   have to interact with artefacts spread all around one particular city.
   In the last decade HCI has experienced a significant evolution towards a
   desired fully natural user interface, for example in what concerns the
   ability to recognize a wide range of hand gestures in real-time. Some
   efforts have lately been made in the hardware sector in order to deploy
   sensors that may gather information about the human body movements, as
   detailed as possible. One example of this effort is the Kinect Sensor
   from Microsoft. Nevertheless, although these solutions provide a
   solution for the body movement, they lack on the details, namely the
   hands, given their small dimension compared to the body as a whole. In
   other words, the SDKs provided by the vendors of these devices usually
   lack on the needed details concerning hand movements that would be
   needed for an accurate hand gesture recognition implementation. This
   paper presents an extension to the Kinect SDK based on a contour
   analysis for the estimation of the hand position. This algorithms are
   then used to provide the creation of a gesture library that might be
   used afterwards. (c) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   integrates an accessible campus map design with an interactive Android
   navigation mobile application to permit the identification of convenient
   accessible pathways within campus. In the project design phase, after a
   review of available accessibility maps elsewhere, usability studies were
   conducted in order to ensure that the application will meet the needs of
   the users. In the development phase, an accessibility layer was created
   on top of Google maps to display the accessible information on campus
   buildings, including convenient paths. This two-phase approach provides
   all students and visitors with critical accessibility information about
   the Kean University campus, while assisting researchers to design better
   overall user experiences in human computer interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions for visually impaired take place in the traditional

   study of communication and collaboration activities for 43 visually
   impaired chess players in India. Through semi-structured interviews, the
   participants' experiences in using existing collaboration and
   communication channels were noted. A Grounded Theory based analysis was
   performed using Atlas.ti and themes were identified. Research indicates
   that social collaboration and `staying in touch', searching and sharing
   new information, exploiting existing ways of mobile interactions, and
   having several interests help visually impaired in their daily lives for
   social collaboration and communication. This study provides insights
   concerning designing CSCW mediums for them.}},

Title = {{Novel Virtual User Models of Mild Cognitive Impairment for Simulating

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Virtual user modeling research has attempted to address critical issues
   of human-computer interaction (HCI) such as usability and utility
   through a large number of analytic, usability-oriented approaches as
   cognitive models in order to provide users with experiences fitting to
   their specific needs. However, there is demand for more specific modules
   embodied in cognitive architecture that will detect abnormal cognitive
   decline across new synthetic task environments. Also, accessibility
   evaluation of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) requires considerable
   effort for enhancing ICT products accessibility for older adults. The
   main aim of this study is to develop and test virtual user models (VUM)
   simulating mild cognitive impairment (MCI) through novel specific
   modules, embodied at cognitive models and defined by estimations of
   cognitive parameters. Well-established MCI detection tests assessed
   users' cognition, elaborated their ability to perform multitasks, and
   monitored the performance of infotainment related tasks to provide more
   accurate simulation results on existing conceptual frameworks and
   enhanced predictive validity in interfaces' design supported by
   increased tasks' complexity to capture a more detailed profile of users'
   capabilities and limitations. The final outcome is a more robust
   cognitive prediction model, accurately fitted to human data to be used
   for more reliable interfaces' evaluation through simulation on the basis
   of virtual models of MCI users.}},

   access for this population still remains difficult. Today, web
   accessibility is practically restricted to the normative accessibility

   accessibility, which ensures that the users can reach their goal, is
   therefore forgotten at the expense of the interface usability. Thus, we
   proposed the conceptualization of a technical solution which attains
   effective accessibility by solving the information filtering problem
   encountered by blind people. The conceptualization of this solution,
   supported by previous experimental results, seems promising to make web

Abstract = {{Visual maps must be transcribed into (interactive) raised-line maps to
   be accessible for visually impaired people. However, these tactile maps
   suffer from several shortcomings: they are long and expensive to
   produce, they cannot display a large amount of information, and they are
   not dynamically modifiable. A number of methods have been developed to
   automate the production of raised-line maps, but there is not yet any
   tactile map editor on the market. Tangible interactions proved to be an
   efficient way to help a visually impaired user manipulate spatial
   representations. Contrary to raised-line maps, tangible maps can be
   autonomously constructed and edited. In this paper, we present the
   scenarios and the main expected contributions of the AccessiMap project,
   which is based on the availability of many sources of open spatial data:
   1/ facilitating the production of interactive tactile maps with the
   development of an open-source web-based editor; 2/ investigating the use
   of tangible interfaces for the autonomous construction and exploration
   of a map by a visually impaired user.}},

Journal = {{NEW LIBRARY WORLD}},

Pages = {{503-516}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This study aims to determine the state of library services to
   people with disabilities in the USA since the last study conducted in
   2008. Social capital theory provides a lens to reconceptualize equal
   access in a global context, and to offer insights on the effects of new
   information technologies for re-envisioning universal access. Strategic
   alliances with education and human-computer interaction researchers are
   proposed.
   Design/methodology/approach - Librarians serving the National Library
   Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS/BPH) were
   surveyed. Questions addressed clientele, services, technologies, career
   opportunities, leadership, library and information science (LIS)
   education and librarian demographics.
   Findings - Human resources, leadership, outreach and out-of-the-box
   solutions applying mainstream technologies are identified as major
   challenges to the future of information access for disabled persons
   through the NLS/BPH system.
   Research limitations/implications - The survey was limited to librarians
   serving the NLS/BPH. A similar survey distributed in other nations could
   expand the possibilities of future research and collaboration.
   Practical implications - Information from this survey can aid
   information professionals planning delivery of information services to
   disabled patrons. Suggestions for shifting from special access to
   universal access philosophy ensure access for all. Results can also help
   LIS educators prepare graduates to serve an aging population that will
   challenge standard methods of information access and services.
   Originality/value - This study provides the current perspective of
   services to persons with disabilities compared to findings by the
   researchers in 2008. Since the first survey in 2008, the service has
   been updated through a national effort of digitization. This study is
   the first comparative study of the NLS.}},

Abstract = {{Sometimes people look for freedom in the virtual world. However, not all
   have the possibility to interact with a computer in the same way.
   Nowadays, almost every job requires interaction with computerized
   systems, so people with physical impairments do not have the same
   freedom to control a mouse, a keyboard or a touchscreen. In the last
   years, some of the government programs to help people with reduced
   mobility suffered a lot with the global economic crisis and some of
   those programs were even cut down to reduce costs. This paper focuses on
   the development of a touchless human-computer interface, which allows
   anyone to control a computer without using a keyboard, mouse or
   touchscreen. By reusing Microsoft Kinect sensors from old videogames
   consoles, a cost-reduced, easy to use, and open-source interface was
   developed, allowing control of a computer using only the head, eyes or
   mouth movements, with the possibility of complementary sound commands.
   There are already available similar commercial solutions, but they are
   so expensive that their price tends to be a real obstacle in their
   purchase; on the other hand, free solutions usually do not offer the
   freedom that people with reduced mobility need. The present solution
   tries to address these drawbacks. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an Java-based mobile service that enables
   blind-environment interaction through voice-augmented objects. To make
   this possible, it is necessary to tag the object with an associated
   radio frequency identification and record its voice-based description.
   The blind users can later use the service to scan surrounding augmented
   objects and verbalize their identity and characteristics. We use a user
   centred design in order to guarantee the accessibility of the service
   for visually impaired and blind people. The required hardware is a near
   field communication-enabled mobile phone with built-in accelerometer.
   The client-side application does not require pushing any buttons,
   browsing any menus, or touching any screens to select and activate any
   of supported modes: registration, calibration, voice recording, physical
   object identification, delete voice recording(s), cloud-based file sync
   and share. Twelve visually impaired individuals (aged 31-84, 6 men and 6
   women) have tested the service in two different scenarios: (1) a test
   based on comparison with a PenFriend labeling unit, and (2) a users'
   experience test. The results show that selected tangible, multimodal
   interface (object touching, phone shaking and tilt, voice output) can be
   used very easily (58\%) or easily (33\%) by blind and visually impaired
   users who have had no previous experience with other mobile services.
   Most of participants from the test group agreed that the service could
   be useful for their daily activities. The service can be used both at
   home and in public buildings for voice description of objects such as
   food, medicines, books, clothes, cosmetics, CD/DVDs, rooms, etc.}},

Abstract = {{Haptic assistance is an emerging field of research that is designed to
   improve human-computer interaction (HCI) by reducing error rates and
   targeting times through the use of force feedback. Haptic feedback has
   previously been investigated to assist motion-impaired computer users,
   however, limitations such as target distracters have hampered its
   integration with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). In this paper two new
   haptic assistive techniques are presented that utilise the 3DOF
   capabilities of the Phantom Omni. These are referred to as deformable
   haptic cones and deformable virtual switches. The assistance is designed
   specifically to enable motion-impaired operators to use existing GUIs
   more effectively. Experiment 1 investigates the performance benefits of
   the new haptic techniques when used in conjunction with the densely
   populated Windows on-screen keyboard (OSK). Experiment 2 utilises the
   ISO 9241-9 point-and-click task to investigate the effects of target
   size and shape. The results of the study prove that the newly proposed
   techniques improve interaction rates and can be integrated with existing
   software without many of the drawbacks of traditional haptic assistance.
   Deformable haptic cones and deformable virtual switches were shown to
   reduce the mean number of missed-clicks by at least 75\% and reduce
   targeting times by at least 25\%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Delegation is the practice of sharing authority with another individual
   to enable them to complete a specific task as a proxy. Practices to
   permit delegation can range from formal to informal arrangements and can
   involve spontaneous yet finely balanced notions of trust between people.
   This paper argues that delegation is a ubiquitous yet an unsupported
   feature of socio-technical computer systems and that this lack of
   support illustrates a particular neglect to the everyday financial
   practices of the more vulnerable people in society. Our contribution is
   to provide a first exploration of the domain of person-to-person
   delegation in digital payments, a particularly pressing context. We
   first report qualitative data collected across several studies
   concerning banking practices of individuals over 80 years of age. We
   then use analytical techniques centred upon identification of
   stakeholders, their concerns and interactions, to characterize the
   delegation practices we observed. We propose a Concerns Matrix as a
   suitable representation to capture conflicts in the needs of individuals
   in such complex socio-technical systems, and finally propose a putative
   design response in the form of a Helper Card.}},

Abstract = {{Contextual understanding, which consists of memory, reasoning, and
   recall, is a key process of human-computer interactions and interfaces
   which provide universal accessibility. To determine the possibility of
   predicting the recall accuracy of reading and memorizing tasks using
   features of oculo-motors, eye movements, and pupillary changes, a
   contextual understanding task experiment, which was composed of
   definition and question statements, was conducted. The existence of a
   relationship between the features of oculo-motors during memorization
   and recall performance was hypothesized. The features of viewer's
   oculo-motors while reading and judging a statement were observed, and
   significant differences were identified in most features according to
   the correctness of responses. The possibility of predicting the
   verification accuracy of question statements using these features for
   definition statements and the support vector regression technique was
   established, and there was a significant correlational relationship
   between the predicted accuracy and the experimental accuracy. Also, the
   estimation performance for judging question statements was assessed
   using the features and support vector machines. Estimation accuracy was
   the highest when all extracted features of eye movements were used. The
   number of definition statements, which were experimental conditions used
   to control the task difficulty, affected the accuracy of both prediction
   and estimation. These results provide evidence that features of
   oculo-motors during the reading, memorizing, and recalling of statements
   can be used as an index of contextual understanding.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Rich Internet applications have removed most of the constraints of Web
   1.0 while giving users more responsiveness and advanced browsing and
   interaction experiences. These new horizons, however, raise many
   challenges for people with disabilities or using limited hardware and
   software technologies, whose risk to be excluded from the benefits
   deriving from advanced web applications. To address this problem, WCAG
   2.0 guidelines have been released as the newest World Wide Web
   Consortium recommendation for accessible web content, and WAI-ARIA is a
   candidate recommendation which provides reference specifications for
   accessible rich Internet applications. However, both specifications
   contain a huge amount of information that often discourages most web
   designers from dealing with accessibility issues. Moreover, guidelines
   are suitable and usually adopted to judge a design solution a
   posteriori, but they do not suggest how to face a design problem
   constructively. This paper proposes a design pattern language for
   accessibility. The language can be regarded as a universal design
   resource for helping web designers create accessible rich Internet
   applications compliant with the most recent standards. Knowledge
   representation through design patterns reflects the problem-solving
   approach usually followed by software and web designers, while pattern
   organization in a structured language aims to guide web designers
   throughout the design process. The language has been implemented as an
   accessible rich Internet application itself, thus allowing designers
   with disabilities to participate in web design. In order to evaluate the
   design pattern language, a three-step process was carried out including:
   (1) a heuristic analysis with a group of human-computer interaction
   experts, (2) a survey study with a group of web designers, and (3) a
   validation on the field with two designers who have been requested to
   apply the language in real design cases.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{His paper presents a tool facilitating developers of user interfaces
   (UIs) to experience accessibility limitations that can be posed from
   various disabilities during the interaction of impaired users with their
   developments. In this respect, various aspects of visual, hearing,
   physical and cognitive impairments have been modelled through filters
   providing approximate, yet, realistic simulations over them. These
   filters have formed the basis for the developed tool, which can be used
   either on its own (as a standalone application), or be embedded in the
   NetBeans Integrated Development Environment. The tool, named DIAS,
   allows for impairment simulations to be performed over Java, mobile and
   web applications. Moreover, it integrates two of the most common
   assistive technologies (ATs), namely a screen reader and a magnifier. As
   a result, developers of UIs can not only experience how interaction
   would be affected from various impairments, but they can also understand
   how their developments would be perceived by impaired users through an
   AT. This work aims to provide an integrated, practical solution for
   impairment simulation, which could be easily adopted by developers, thus
   realistically increasing the possibilities for the future development of
   interactive applications that are more accessible to users with
   disabilities.}},

Abstract = {{With ever more everyday objects becoming ``smart{''} due to embedded
   processors and communication capabilities, the provisioning of intuitive
   user interfaces to control smart things is quickly gaining importance.
   We present a model-based interface description scheme that enables
   automatic, modality-independent user interface generation. User
   interface description languages based on our approach carry enough
   information to suggest intuitive interfaces while still being easily
   producible for developers. This is enabled by describing the atomic
   interactive components of a device and capturing the semantics of
   interactions with the device. We propose a taxonomy of abstract sensing
   and actuation primitives and present a smartphone application that can
   act as a ubiquitous device controller. An evaluation of the mobile
   application in a laboratory setup, home environments, and an educational
   setting as well as the results of a user study highlight the
   accessibility of the proposed scheme for application developers and its
   suitability for controlling smart devices.}},

Abstract = {{Handheld devices such as smartphones and tablets are becoming useful in

   However, for handheld devices to be effective, the display must be able
   to perform well in a wide range of ambient illumination conditions. We
   conducted visual experiments to quantify user performance for testing
   the image quality of two current-generation devices in different ambient
   illumination conditions while measuring ambient light levels with a
   real-time illuminance meter. We found and quantified that due to the
   high reflectivity of handheld devices, performance deteriorates as the
   user moves from dark areas into environments of greater ambient
   illumination. The quantitative analysis suggests that differences in
   display reflection coefficients do not affect the low illumination
   performance of the device but rather the performance at higher levels of
   illumination.}},

Abstract = {{Although extensive research has been carried out on virtual learning
   environments and the role of groups and communities in social networks,
   few studies exist which adequately cover the relationship between these
   two domains. In this paper, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of
   integrating these two environments by creating a novel prototype and
   conducting a preliminary pilot evaluation session. For the prototype
   system, a Facebook Group was utilised as a repository for learning
   content and the Open Wonderland platform was selected as a mixed reality
   intelligent environment for 3D virtual collaborative activities. Since
   tacit knowledge can be gained via collaborative group-based activities
   and discussions, a new Wonderland module was developed to integrate this
   platform with the Facebook group. Similarly, explicit knowledge can be
   learned directly via the prepared materials which are provided within
   the group repository. We hope to demonstrate that this approach can
   provide greater accessibility to the learning content since it can be
   accessed from both the 3D world and the 2D Facebook Group. In other
   words, this system can support both synchronous interaction as well as
   asynchronous data retrieval. Finally, the prototype system was evaluated
   by means of a two-hour task-based assessment and user-satisfaction
   questionnaire. We present the key findings from this pilot study (which
   were very encouraging), and propose further ideas for the future
   refinement of the concepts presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{With the advancement in touch based devices these days, new and better
   options are coming to the fore every day. The increasing penetration of
   touch-based smart devices into the lives of normal users is an excellent
   example to portray the importance of such technology among varied user
   groups. However, the biggest challenge still is to make them cater the
   needs of everyone and use of latest technology should be possible
   irrespective of their varying physical abilities. In this proposal the
   focus is on motor disabled people who do not have much control on their
   limbs and free movement is very difficult for them. And hence the touch
   based interface is not a comfortable option for such users, since
   interacting with such devices requires performing gestures and actions
   on screen. To meet this challenge a grid-based screen traversal
   technique is suggested in this paper, which does not require direct
   contact with interface, but can be controlled using an external switch
   and minimal movement of limbs.}},

Abstract = {{California State University, Northridge (CSUN), like many large urban
   institutions, has a very diverse student body. This diversity is not
   only reflected in ethnic and racial differences, but also in the
   students' educational backgrounds. Our institution enrolls a large
   number of transfer students, mostly from community colleges in
   California. These students face a number of challenges, including the
   adjustment to a new learning environment, issues related to transfer
   credits, and the necessity of taking additional courses to complete
   lower division major requirements.
   In 2011, CSUN received a five-year, \$5.5 million dollar HSI-STEM grant
   from the Department of Education to address the challenges faced by
   transfer students from under-represented groups. Glendale Community
   College and College of the Canyons are partners in the grant. The main
   goals of the grant are to recruit promising students from community
   colleges, and then provide them with financial and academic support to
   ensure their success. There are also opportunities to work on summer
   research projects under the guidance of their faculty mentors. The
   initial cohort of students that entered the program is now nearing
   graduation.
   Students in the program are enrolled in a variety of engineering
   disciplines, including computer science, and are expected to spend
   additional time on campus in order to become more fully engaged in their
   department's activities. Assessment of the academic impact of these
   experiences on the first cohort of transfer students in this program is
   presented. Also considered is the impact of working on summer research
   projects with their faculty mentors. Specific benefits were associated
   with research interaction with faculty, including faculty accessibility
   and responsiveness, faculty research connections to coursework and
   career, and academic effects of student-faculty research interaction on
   students. This paper also describes a particular summer research project
   performed by a group of mechanical engineering students (five from CSUN
   and two from Glendale CC) in the summer of 2013. Their work was related
   to CSUN's human powered vehicle project, which is one of the senior
   capstone options for mechanical engineering students. Specifically, the
   group worked on developing methodologies for predicting drag on human
   powered vehicles, using the previous year's vehicle as a test bed. The
   drag on this vehicle was estimated using computer simulation, wind
   tunnel tests, and field measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Technology solutions to support teaching and learning are being used
   across the world in various contexts. Virtual Learning Environments
   (VLEs) are being deployed both in formal and information learning
   contexts to support learning across a number of different disciplines
   and subjects. In most of the cases, the role of the technology is to
   enhance and augment teaching and learning with the realization that the
   technology has to be coupled with appropriate: pedagogical alignment,
   technology tools, learning models and frameworks. The research and
   thinking around technology-supported teaching and learning has matured
   over the years, furthered by the developments from both the Education
   and the Information Technology (IT) disciplines. One of the insights
   that has been developed from the IT discipline is that of developing
   solutions and technologies that are relevant and sensitive to the
   context of deployment, this is usually considered from the
   personalization and internationalization perspective. The research on
   personalization is typically realized within the fields of Human
   Computer Interaction and Adaptive Hypermedia Systems. These two fields
   form the theoretical backdrop for our research. In this paper we present
   research on the use of a VLE within a learning institution in South
   Africa - we discuss the observations with regards to the usage patterns
   of the VLE and in particular discuss its role in supporting teaching and
   learning activities. Subsequently we present two separate efforts that
   were undertaken to improve the usability and accessibility of the VLE.
   This was through the implementation of two interfaces for accessing the
   resources on the VLE. The first was a telephony interface which allowed
   audio presentation of some of the VLE content with support for Dual-Tone
   Multi-Frequency (DTMF) interaction from the users. The second was an
   interface to allow access to the VLE from low-end feature phones.
   Subsequent to implementing these two interfaces for accessing the VLE,
   our observation was that they not only sought to improve the usability
   of the VLE within the formal learning institution context -they also
   opened up opportunities for usage within an Information and
   Communications Technologies for Development (ICTD) project that we
   undertake for eSkilling marginalized rural communities in South Africa.
   In these communities, the literacy level is typically low and while
   access to computing facilities is very limited, there is a high
   availability of low-end feature phones in the community. The literacy
   level challenge and limited access to computing facilities can therefore
   be addressed by the telephony interface and low-end feature phones
   interface respectively. The paper concludes by highlighting general
   observations on the role of technology to support learning within ICTD
   contexts and the associated implications on lifelong learning in these
   typically marginalized communities.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile devices are irrevocably changing learning. Mobile technologies
   are interfacing with all aspects of our lives including Web tools and
   applications, immersive virtual world environments, and online
   environments to present educational opportunities for learning.
   Mobile Learning is a real need today, driven by natural penetration of
   information technology in all areas of economic life, the needs to align
   education to economic and social requirements. Mobile learning is a new
   trend in learning environment, that allows the access of users to the
   information through Internet using mobile devices like phones,
   smartphones, PDAs, laptops, tablets.
   Mobile devices present special means of interaction with the user which
   are not similarly with classic computer applications, therefore special
   attention should be given to this issue. Mobile technologies have
   attracted a lot of attention, which offer a possible solution for the
   implementation of technology in education environment. Interface design
   must take into account a number of factors associated with human
   interaction: accessibility, ease of use, level of skill, capturing and
   reporting errors.
   Mobile devices represents presently an attraction for students, so that
   according our case study 90\% of the university population owns a mobile
   phone and see this phone as their single most important form of
   communication. They link learners in new ways to other learners and
   information. This constant access to information offers learners new
   ways to party, dream, play, and learn in ways never before visualized.
   But this always-on communication has led to a millennial language with
   76\% using instant messaging/text messaging and 15\% logged on 24/7.
   As teachers, we have always tried to take a holistic view of teaching
   and learning and prepare our students through a combination of skills,
   knowledge and dispositions. What is different is that now as teachers we
   have competition in the form or devices that can deliver content
   quickly, access experts, and connect to anyone, anywhere.
   We are still in the early days of mobile learning and its application.
   Students can play a major role through the development of apps that
   become institutional resources and part of the institution's
   infrastructure. Most of the time, students are pioneers in forcing us as
   educators to change. However, once the student work becomes part of the
   university infrastructure, the apps may be outsourced just like the
   university website and other centralized IT work of the university.
   Mobile devices increase the opportunity for student/faculty interaction.
   Text messages, Skype calls and constant email can become a 24/7 event
   for the faculty member. The expectations of a mobile-based learning will
   have to be negotiated such that both faculty and student are not
   invading each other's social and private spaces and time.
   According to our research results, there are some key mobile learning
   benefits: Is more convenient; Is more relevant; Can take place during
   down time; Eliminates technological barriers; Empowers learners; Results
   in better professional judgments; Affords numerous social learning
   opportunities, etc.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to inform on findings from a mature body of
   research titled SoundScapes. The goal was to define, create and question
   sensor-based ICT systems, techniques and methods to supplement
   traditional rehabilitation. Following initial biofeedback/sensorimotor
   tests, a non-invasive (non-wearable/gesture-based) motion-sensitive
   sensor system enabling human performance control of computer-generated
   multimedia was originated. Digital music making via motion data was
   originally investigated as a strategy to train physical impairment.
   Gesture-control of painting, robot control, and video games followed.
   Commonly referred to as Virtual Reality therapy, the work was applied
   within wide arrays of participants marginalized by their disability.
   Outcomes point to an optimal solution as an adaptive flexible system
   that could be mixed and matched to an individual's profile coupled with
   an intervention approach to maximize a participant's development.
   Emergent are models toward establishing valid and replicable techniques
   and methods to evolve new digital test batteries to assess clinical
   evidence. Human-machine, human-human interactions, and information
   exchange are core of the research. Published patents resulted from the
   work. Conclusions summarize how accessibility, inclusion and
   rehabilitation have been influenced by such non-invasive sensor-based
   gesture-control of multimedia. Another main conclusion is the need for
   new strategies of staff training with ICT due to their key role in the
   rehabilitation process. Contemporary adoptions of gesture-controlled
   video games and creative recreation in rehabilitation indicate ongoing
   potentials and influence.}},

Abstract = {{Design science has evolved as a major research paradigm in the
   information systems (IS) discipline, which aims to design innovative and
   useful IT artifacts, such as conceptual models and software systems.
   Despite the increasing attention paid to the cognitive and emotional
   mechanisms that underlie the perception of such artifacts, research that
   explores the neurobiological determinants of these mechanisms has only
   recently begun to emerge. The primary argument for the use of
   neurobiological approaches in IS design science research is that IT
   artifact design - and, ultimately, human-computer interaction in general
   - may significantly benefit from neuroscience theories, concepts,
   methods, and data. In particular, the consideration of neuroscience may
   improve IT artifacts' alignment with users' perceptual and information
   processing mechanisms, particularly the brain. Against this background,
   this article presents a taxonomy of application strategies for
   neuroscience in IS design science research. It describes three major
   areas of application and explains that conducting research in an area
   comes with a specific set of requirements (e.g., applicability, costs,
   accessibility, and knowledge relevant to planning and conducting a
   research project). Therefore, if an IS design science scholar decides to
   draw upon neuroscience, the taxonomy transparently explains possible
   working areas and corresponding requirements. The taxonomy is described
   based on example studies published in the IS literature and on
   contributions that appeared in outlets pertaining to related
   disciplines, such as affective computing and neuroergonomics. The
   article concludes that, if neuroscience is considered a valuable
   complement to the more traditional approaches, it has the potential to
   become a major reference discipline for IS design science research.}},

Abstract = {{Among the infinite options that are only limited by one's creativity,
   many different applications are flourishing in the context of cultural
   heritage. In fact, while cultural heritage is often hard to understand
   or even only to reach, technology is today providing all with a powerful
   access key to many of its very different instances. Such key can be
   based on traditional means of communication and explanation (e. g.,
   audio guides), or also ambitiously exploit novel ways of representation
   and visualization (e. g., augmented reality renderings). Our
   contribution in this area is that of designing and implementing a mobile
   app that supports the navigation of Giuseppe Verdi-related cultural
   sites. Unlike any other app, ours proposes an innovative human-computer
   interaction scheme that supports mood-based browsing of cultural
   information across multiple museums at once. In practice, our app is
   capable of determining a user's mood and, based on such information, of
   providing visit suggestions as well as accessibility to content that
   matches the given mood state.}},

   development and testing of a learning platform for the mechatronics
   module; (2) learning exercises specifically tailored to laboratory
   objectives; (3) the convenience and user-friendliness of the proposed
   system; (4) the technical aspects of the platform in question; (5) the

Abstract = {{While many instructors need to focus on the syllabus, subject content,
   administrative tasks, and students with varying learning styles, they
   may also need to address various learning style of students with
   disabilities. Many universities offer teacher training, but their
   training may not be detailed enough to help instructors be prepared to
   work with classroom accommodations for students with disabilities. In
   particular, online (virtual) instructors have another factor to work
   with in this situation, they have to work with students with
   disabilities virtually and offer similar or comparable accommodations.
   Many educational institutions are seeing that more students are
   enrolling in online programs and courses, and they realize that there
   may be some additional barriers to learning in terms of this learning
   environment's technical process and structure. In particular, students
   with disabilities are enrolling even more with online courses with the
   hopes of a barrier-free environment. Thus, there are still some barriers
   still present in the learning environment in terms of technical/software
   application or interaction/communication problems. The purpose of this
   paper will be to look at how a university can address such problems and
   develop/create virtual solutions to these barriers by incorporating the
   help of others in the online community to brainstorm methods of inquiry
   and build virtual strategies. In particular, there needs to be a special
   emphasis given to online instructors to become better prepared and
   trained with technology in terms of structure and how to motivate all
   types of students, especially students with disabilities, to become more
   interactive online. Thus, there is a growing need for more human
   computer interaction, rather than just selecting and clicking single
   choices. Consequently, universities need to design and develop training
   programs to help educate and train current and potential instructors in
   the areas of disability awareness, virtual classroom accommodations for
   students with disabilities, as well as to create strategies for better
   learning opportunities for these students. The key focus with this
   training program would be to create better strategies to help increase
   better human computing opportunities for all types of students. While
   many instructors may not be facilitating learning for this particular
   population at this time, the virtual learning environment is starting to
   attract more students with disabilities with a growing need to help them
   become more successful in their educational endeavors. Finally, this
   presentation will help to offer more insight as to the role and function
   of instructors in meeting the needs of students with disabilities.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, computer application development has experienced
   exponential growth, not only in number but also regarding the fields
   that have benefitted from its use. In health science training and
   medicine in particular, the progressive incorporation of technological
   developments has transformed the teaching and learning process,
   resulting in true ``educational technology{''}, which this track focuses
   on given its repercussion and current dissemination. One of the most
   representative examples within educational technology has been the
   development of new content visualization systems, more complete and
   realistic than traditional learning material on paper. These
   applications are true learning environments aimed toward maximizing the
   student's work outside the classroom and the interaction with the
   contents given, an important support or complement to traditional
   teaching. The technological application development with teaching
   purposes in Heath Science is paying increasing attention to mobile
   phones, smartphones and tablets due to their portability, economic
   accessibility and Internet access, maximizing the dissemination and
   availability of developed applications. These changes in health science
   teaching pose a challenge for teachers and institutions when designing,
   developing, implementing and evaluating these technological
   applications, as well as an effort on behalf of students to adapt. Thus,
   it is fitting to provide a space to gather and reflect upon these
   practices in an event like the International Conference on Technology
   Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturalism. Nowadays, a growing number of
   studies have directed their attention to the effectiveness evaluation of
   these applications with increasingly sophisticated designs. The results
   are encouraging and signal a promising future for the development of
   computer applications in health science. The purpose of this track is
   twofold: to offer a general vision on the contribution of medical
   informatics and related fields in health science; and to provide an
   excellent opportunity to promote and exchange innovative teaching
   experiences, especially those based on the application of new
   technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Members of the Deaf communities have been excluded for several years.
   There is a need for computational tools that take into account their
   peculiarities so that the Deaf may fulfill all their human
   possibilities. Even the systems that were supposedly designed for the

   Communities of Practice (CP - a group of people who share some interest
   on a topic, and get together to better understand that topic) cultivate
   interactions. Interactions through collaborative activities mediated by
   computers should be used for social inclusion of the Deaf and Knowledge
   Creation (KC - a social process that encourages learning and development
   of skills). This article has two main objectives: first, it presents the
   results of an ethnographic study of a CP with Deaf and non-Deaf members
   to study SL. Second, the observations from the ethnographic study (based
   on collaboration and communication theories) allowed the researchers to
   determine some requirements, that are compiled and presented here as a
   Conceptual Framework to inform design of Inclusive Collaborative Virtual

Abstract = {{Predefined sequences of eye movements, or `gaze gestures', can be
   consciously performed by humans and monitored non-invasively using
   remote video oculography. Gaze gestures hold great potential in
   human-computer interaction, HCI, as long as they can be easily
   assimilated by potential users, monitored using low cost gaze tracking
   equipment and machine learning algorithms are able to distinguish the
   spatio-temporal structure of intentional gaze gestures from typical gaze
   activity performed during standard HCI. In this work, an evaluation of
   the performance of a bioinspired Bayesian pattern recognition algorithm
   known as Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) on the real time recognition
   of gaze gestures is carried out through a user study. To improve the
   performance of traditional HTM during real time recognition, an
   extension of the algorithm is proposed in order to adapt HTM to the
   temporal structure of gaze gestures. The extension consists of an
   additional top node in the HTM topology that stores and compares
   sequences of input data by sequence alignment using dynamic programming.
   The spatio-temporal codification of a gesture in a sequence serves the
   purpose of handling the temporal evolution of gaze gestures instances.
   The extended HTM allows for reliable discrimination of intentional gaze
   gestures from otherwise standard human-machine gaze interaction reaching
   up to 98\% recognition accuracy for a data set of 10 categories of gaze
   gestures, acceptable completion speeds and a low rate of false positives
   during standard gaze-computer interaction. These positive results
   despite the low cost hardware employed supports the notion of using gaze
   gestures as a new HCI paradigm for the fields of accessibility and
   interaction with smartphones, tablets, projected displays and
   traditional desktop computers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Interaction with future coming Smart Environments requires research on
   methods for the design of a new generation of human-environment
   interfaces. The paper outlines an original approach to the design of
   multimodal applications that, while valid for the integration on today's
   devices, aims also to be sufficiently flexible so as to remain
   consistent in view of the transition to future Smart Environments, which
   will likely be structured in a more complex manner, requiring that
   interaction with services offered by the environment is made available
   through the integration of multimodal/unimodal interfaces provided
   through objects of everyday use. In line with the most recent research
   tendencies, the approach is centred not only on the user interface part
   of a system, but on the design of a comprehensive solution, including a
   dialogue model which is meant to provide a robust support layer on which
   multimodal interaction builds upon. Specific characteristics of the
   approach and of a sample application being developed to validate it are
   discussed in the paper, along with some implementation details. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{PC-based video games are commonly controlled through a combination of
   pointing device and keyboard input. Although this conventional type of
   interface has a long history of successful implementation, a small group
   of people remains excluded due to accessibility issues. This is
   unfortunate, because virtual environment immersion can provide great
   benefits to people suffering from temporary or permanent physical
   disabilities. This work describes the development of a novel
   human-computer interface system that incorporates biosensors in order to
   replace conventional input devices. It will engage this group of
   overlooked users by addressing and eliminating the previously mentioned
   accessibility issues. In this system, the input from an eye-tracking
   device will be used to replace on-screen pointing, and a data-glove will
   be used to replace keyboard input for in-game navigation and
   interaction. It is expected that previously limiting physical conditions
   will be eliminated by the system's effective, effortless, and pleasant
   interaction control implications.}},

Abstract = {{Inclusive learning integrates pedagogical and technological variables.
   It means to adapt to students according to their characteristics
   (personal, physical, cognitive, social ... ), needs and interests. With
   the aim of evaluating the level of inclusion of digital learning objects
   we have developed a questionnaire that collects information about
   pedagogical and technological aspects that promote or discourage
   inclusion. Features like the pedagogical model, function of activities,
   type of assessment, multimedia resources, human-computer interaction,
   accessibility and usability criteria, etc. are variables that impact in
   the level of inclusion of educational objects and items that have been
   included in the questionnaire. This is the second version of the tool,
   refined with the conclusions obtained from the application of the draft
   version to more than 50 learning objects developed under the funding and
   supervision of the Basque Government. These objects are available under
   Creative Commons license in the Agrega web page of the Education
   Department, and represent the style and characteristics of more than 350
   objects. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. Selection

Abstract = {{The advances made in both Human Computer Interfaces (HCIs) and in Mixed
   Reality (MR) systems during the past decade have opened the gates to
   countless new applications in fields ranging from applied science to
   fine arts. In fact, computers have evolved from boxes with which it was
   possible to interact solely using mice, keyboards and monitors, to
   become devices that permeate and intersect with the space where human
   beings live and move, being now capable of interpreting their gestures
   as long as mixing with and contain the objects that surround them. Such
   richness has been widely employed within new and engaging computer
   games, where it is now possible to play while moving and connecting to
   the virtual characters that compose mixed worlds, directly from home.
   However, such potential is far from being fully exploited everywhere. In
   public spaces such as museums and exhibitions, for example, new means of
   interaction and mixed worlds could contemporarily reach two goals: (a)
   augment the user experience, and, (b) increase visitors' accessibility
   to all artifacts. In this work we show how both goals have been achieved
   with the devise and implementation of Mercator Atlas Robot, an
   application that supports the exploration of Mercator's World Atlas, the
   book that first has wholly described the world through a collection of
   maps. In particular, we here describe how the combination of a gestural
   interface and mixed reality paradigms has let visitors travel through
   Mercator's volume in a simple and intuitive way. All this has been
   possible with only low cost, off-the-shelf, hardware, where all the
   intelligence is entirely based on software components.}},

Pages = {{143-230}},
Abstract = {{This chapter reviews the contribution of new information-communication
   technologies to the advancement of educational assessment. Improvements
   can be described in terms of precision in detecting the actual values of
   the observed variables, efficiency in collecting and processing
   information, and speed and frequency of feedback given to the
   participants and stakeholders. The chapter reviews previous research and
   development in two ways, describing the main tendencies in four
   continents (Asia, Australia, Europe and the US) as well as summarizing
   research on how technology advances assessment in certain crucial
   dimensions (assessment of established constructs, extension of
   assessment domains, assessment of new constructs and in dynamic
   situations). As there is a great variety of applications of assessment
   in education, each one requiring different technological solutions, the
   chapter classifies assessment domains, purposes and contexts and
   identifies the technological needs and solutions for each. The chapter
   reviews the contribution of technology to the advancement of the entire
   educational evaluation process, from authoring and automatic generation
   and storage of items, through delivery methods (Internet-based, local
   server, removable media, mini-computer labs) to forms of task
   presentation made possible with technology for response capture, scoring
   and automated feedback and reporting. Finally, the chapter identifies
   areas for which further research and development is needed (migration
   strategies, security, availability, accessibility, comparability,
   framework and instrument compliance) and lists themes for research
   projects feasible for inclusion in the Assessment and Teaching of
   Twenty-first Century Skills project.
   Information communication technology (ICT) offers so many outstanding
   possibilities for teaching and learning that its application has been
   growing steadily in every segment of education. Within the general
   trends of the use of ICT in education, technology-based assessment (TBA)
   represents a rapidly increasing share. Several traditional assessment
   processes can be carried out more efficiently by means of computers. In
   addition, technology offers new assessment methods that cannot be
   otherwise realized. There is no doubt that TBA will replace paper-based
   testing in most of the traditional assessment scenarios, and technology
   will further extend the territories of assessment in education as it
   provides frequent and precise feedback for participants in learning and
   teaching that cannot be achieved by any other means.
   At the same time, large-scale implementation of TBA still faces several
   technological challenges that need further research and a lot of
   experimentation in real educational settings. The basic technological
   solutions are already available, but their application in everyday
   educational practice, especially their integration into educationally
   optimized, consistent systems, requires further developmental work.
   A variety of technological means operate in schools, and the diversity,
   compatibility, connectivity and co-working of those means require
   further considerations. Each new technological innovation finds its way
   to schools but not always in a systematic way. Thus, the possibilities
   of technology-driven modernization of education-when the intent to apply
   emerging technological tools motivates changes-are limited. In this
   chapter, another approach is taken in which the actual and conceivable
   future problems of educational development are considered and the
   available technological means are evaluated according to their potential
   to contribute in solving them.
   Technology may significantly advance educational assessment along a
   number of dimensions. It improves the precision of detecting the actual
   values of the observed variables and the efficiency of collecting and
   processing information; it enables the sophisticated analysis of the
   available data, supports decision-making and provides rapid feedback for
   participants and stakeholders. Technology helps to detect and record the
   psychomotor, cognitive and affective characteristics of students and the
   social contexts of teaching and learning processes alike. When we deal
   with technological issues in educational assessment, we limit our
   analyses of the human side of the human technology interaction. Although
   technological problems in a narrow sense, like the parameters of the
   available instruments-e.g. processor speed, screen resolution,
   connection bandwidth-are crucial in educational application, these
   questions play a secondary role in our study. In this chapter, we mostly
   use the more general term technology-based assessment, meaning that
   there are several technical tools beyond the most commonly used
   computers. Nevertheless, we are aware that in the foreseeable future,
   computers will continue to play a dominant role.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays smart phones are becoming the most widely used portable
   devices. Cell phones significantly enrich daily human life experience by
   providing ubiquitous access to sophisticated multimedia features such as
   voice and data services, short messaging, built-in cameras, Wi-Fi,
   Internet, Bluetooth and many more. Attracted by ``any time and any
   place{''} communication accessibility many educators explore
   opportunities to improve student learning by using either standard phone
   features or applications dedicated for learning needs. In these
   scenarios cell phone is considered as learning content delivery and
   interaction device. While many such studies are reported, another aspect
   hasn't been explored thoroughly-efficient learning strategies for smart
   phone application development itself. This is an important problem for
   electrical and computer engineering students as there exist credit hour
   constraints in curricula, technology changes very fast, and offering
   related chain of courses is not very feasible. This paper presents an
   approach facilitating the introduction to smart phone application
   development using short template projects combined in a template
   library. The idea is to familiarize students with the whole development
   cycle by minimizing code-programming, by having ready-made templates
   which can be manipulated for hands-on experience. The complexity of
   course materials can be varied using different set of modules, and thus
   such learning modules can be offered independently, integrated in other
   conventional courses or used for outreach. With this concept the phone
   application development is demystified, the big picture clarifies, while
   students can learn specific insights according to their needs using
   existing learning tracks. The described system is created for Android
   phones but the idea can apply for other platforms as well. The proposed
   library offers a convenient user interface to facilitate students to
   analyze the image processing techniques by making certain modification
   in the pre-existing code.}},

Abstract = {{This article belongs to the field of Human-Computer Interaction, in the
   context of the access to Mathematics for people with visual
   disabilities. In a school scenario, the students with blindness who
   learn Algebra need to work on mathematical expressions, to collaborate
   and to communicate with their classmates and teacher. This interaction
   is not straightforward between students with and without sight, due to
   the different modalities they use in order to represent mathematical
   contents and to work with them. The computer presents a great
   opportunity to promote this type of interaction, because it allows the
   multimodal representation of mathematical contents. After the conduction
   of experiments on linear equation solving with students with and without
   sight, we have modelled their intentions and actions and we present a
   proposal for the interactions required in a multimodal interface serving
   this purpose. Lastly, we consider the possibilities and limitations for
   implementation.}},

   facilitate interactive sharing of user generated content are of
   particular importance, when it comes to Web 2.0 technologies. In this
   respect it soon turned out, that Web 2.0 services cannot only be made
   accessible by applying common design guidelines and ad-hoc adap-tations.
   In addition to conventional software ergonomic verification procedures,
   accessibility validation has to rely on sociological reasoning about
   unique Web 2.0 entities and corresponding usage obstacles. Empirically
   these considerations have been conceptualized by an online survey
   amongst 671 respondents with all kinds of different disabilities,

Abstract = {{Spoken dialogue based human-machine interfaces (HMI) are becoming more
   and more widely integrated in computer applications. Speech allows doing
   some task easier and faster. The combination with a more traditional
   means of inputs and outputs - i.e. the multimodality factor becomes more
   and m ore important allowing wider accessibility. It is important to
   model and design spoken language dialog trees to imitate the natural
   conversations in the human-computer interactions, especially in
   information retrieval systems and applications. The paper presents three
   algorithms of HMI dialogs and the results of their experimental
   evaluation. The results showed that it is possible to achieve about 97\%
   recognition accuracy in simple phrase based dialog conversations and
   about 93\% in a very naturally sounding keyword spotting based dialogs.}},

Abstract = {{E-Health is referred to the application of Information and Communication
   Technologies (ICT) to the wide range of issues affecting the health care
   field. For example this may include the process starting with the
   registration and the diagnosis, to patients' follow-up as well as the
   organizational management related to each of these activities. From a
   citizen' viewpoint, e-Health provides considerable advantages related to
   information personalization which in some cases can include alternative
   diagnoses. From a health professional's viewpoint, e-Health refers to
   the actual improved access to relevant information, which, for example,
   can be directly associated with major medical journals and associations,
   electronic prescribing and overall accessibility to patients'
   personalized health information by ease of access to Medical Records
   (MR). However, current solutions do not provide real time access to such
   MRs especially in cases of emergency such as accidents. Therefore, in
   this paper, we present a new solution for e-Health, named KAU-Health;
   KAU-Health is a new system based on cloud computing which allows
   hospital users to interact in real time, and obtain critical
   information, which is crucial for immediate decisions making.}},

Abstract = {{The World Wide Web is becoming increasingly necessary for everybody
   regardless of age, gender, culture, health and individual disabilities.
   Unfortunately, there are evidently still problems for some deaf and hard
   of hearing people trying to use certain web pages. These people require
   the translation of existing written information into their first
   language, which can be one of many sign languages. In previous
   technological solutions, the video window dominates the screen,
   interfering with the presentation and thereby distracting the general
   public, who have no need of a bilingual web site. One solution to this
   problem is the development of transparent sign language videos which
   appear on the screen on request. Therefore, we have designed and
   developed a system to enable the embedding of selective interactive
   elements into the original text in appropriate locations, which act as
   triggers for the video translation into sign language. When the short
   video clip terminates, the video window is automatically closed and the
   original web page is shown. In this way, the system significantly
   simplifies the expansion and availability of additional accessibility
   functions to web developers, as it preserves the original web page with
   the addition of a web layer of sign language video. Quantitative and
   qualitative evaluation has demonstrated that information presented
   through a transparent sign language video increases the users' interest
   in the content of the material by interpreting terms, phrases or
   sentences, and therefore facilitates the understanding of the material
   and increases its usefulness for deaf people.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, biomaterials research has focused on developing functional
   implant surfaces with well-defined topographic nanostructures in order
   to influence protein adsorption and cellular behavior. To enhance our
   understanding of how proteins interact with such surfaces, we analyze
   the adsorption of lysozyme on an oppositely charged nanostructure using
   a computer simulation. We present an algorithm that combines simulated
   Brownian dynamics with numerical field calculation methods to predict
   the preferred adsorption sites for arbitrarily shaped substrates. Either
   proteins can be immobilized at their initial adsorption sites or surface
   diffusion can be considered. Interactions are analyzed on the basis of
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verway-Overbeek (DLVO) theory, including electrostatic
   and London dispersion forces, and numerical solutions are derived using
   the Poisson-Boltzmann and Hamaker equations. Our calculations show that
   for a grooved nanostructure (i.e., groove and plateau width 8 nm, height
   4 nm), proteins first contact the substrate primarily near convex edges
   because of better geometric accessibility and increased electric field
   strengths. Subsequently, molecules migrate by surface diffusion into
   grooves and concave corners, where short-range dispersion interactions
   are maximized. In equilibrium, this mechanism leads to an increased
   surface protein concentration in the grooves, demonstrating that the
   total amount of protein per surface area can be increased if substrates
   have concave nanostructures.}},

   characteristics that may affect the usability of such tools. We
   understand socio-cultural characteristics to be the norms, values, and
   beliefs that mediate the interactions between the structures and
   institutions of science (i.e. disciplines, universities, funding
   organizations), and its practitioners. These factors are not necessarily
   distinct from the technical features of a database, but do nevertheless
   affect the context in which one chooses to use a particular set of
   tools. We have developed three socio-cultural characteristics of
   bioinformatics database usability: accessibility, utility, and
   portability. By `accessibility', we mean the social and cultural
   attributes that make resources open and available for use, such as
   intellectual property arrangements or institutional reputation and
   prestige. `Utility' in this context means the perceived usefulness of a
   database, which can be determined by non-technical matters such as trust
   and taste. `Portability' refers to the social aspects of criteria such
   as maintenance funding, and input and storing standards that allow a
   database to move through space and time. In this article, we call for a
   social science research programme on these - and other - socio-cultural
   characteristics to usability. We invite researchers in human-computer
   interaction, bioinformatics, usability engineering and other areas to
   extend their work to examine the social contexts in which these systems
   are used, and the sociocultural factors that mediate their use. Such a
   research programme would increase the multidisciplinary nature of these
   emergent fields, and help address the complexities of work in the
   post-genomic era.}},

Abstract = {{Assembly planning and evaluation is an important component of the
   product design process in which details about how parts of a new product
   will be put together are formalized. A well designed assembly process
   should take into account various factors such as optimum assembly time
   and sequence, tooling and fixture requirements, ergonomics, operator
   safety, and accessibility, among others. Existing computer-based tools
   to support virtual assembly either concentrate solely on representation
   of the geometry of parts and fixtures and evaluation of clearances and
   tolerances or use simulated human mannequins to approximate human
   interaction in the assembly process. Virtual reality technology has the
   potential to support integration of natural human motions into the
   computer aided assembly planning environment (Ritchie et al. in Proc I
   MECH E Part B J Eng 213(5):461-474, 1999). This would allow evaluations
   of an assembler's ability to manipulate and assemble parts and result in
   reduced time and cost for product design. This paper provides a review
   of the research in virtual assembly and categorizes the different
   approaches. Finally, critical requirements and directions for future
   research are presented.}},

   designing a computer agent to learn and reason about abstract emotion
   concepts can provide further theoretical insights. While natural
   language poses many challenges for the computer in human-computer
   interaction, the accessibility of natural language has made it possible
   to acquire data of many players reasoning about emotions in human-human
   games. These data are used to automate a computer questioner agent that
   asks the user questions and, based on that user's answers, attempts to
   guess the emotion that the user has in mind.}},

   to relay nonverbal messages to a blind user. The device will communicate
   the identities and facial expressions of communication partners in
   realtime. In order to ensure that this device will be useful to the
   blind community, we conducted surveys and interviews and we are working
   with subjects to test prototypes of the device. This paper describes the
   algorithms and design concepts incorporated in this device, and it
   provides a commentary on early survey and interview results. A

Abstract = {{World of Warcraft (TM) (WoW) is a virtual 3D game that offers much in
   terms of entertainment and collaboration and enjoys extraordinary world
   wide popularity. However like many other applications that deliver the
   majority of information visually, the default user interface (UI) is
   potentially only marginally accessible to users with limited visual
   acuity. This paper describes the enhanced user interface (UI) we
   constructed to improve accessibility for these users. We performed a
   study comparing the two user interfaces; users had simulated low visual
   acuity. The results of the study suggest that our enhanced UI led to
   significant improvements in user performance and speed of game play. Our
   current enhanced UI and planned future work have great potential for
   expanding opportunities for a user group to participate in the WoW
   community more fully than is possible with the current UI.}},

Abstract = {{Accessibility in ICT and web-based applications has become an issue of
   great importance during the last years. However, the notion of
   accessibility was until recently undervalued in the web services domain.
   Trying to fill this gap, this paper presents work conducted towards
   enabling web services (WS) with accessibility characteristics, trying to
   ensure that HCI through applications utilizing them is accessible. For
   this purpose, a WS accessibility assessment framework has been deployed,
   having as basis guidelines which if followed, can ensure that accessible
   WSs are developed. In order to further facilitate the development of
   accessible WSs, a WS accessibility assessment tool has been developed on
   the basis of the proposed framework. In its current implementation, the
   tool is capable to automatically assess whether SOAP-or REST-based
   services conform to proposed guidelines. Thus, by using this tool,
   developers can be significantly facilitated towards developing
   accessible web services, or also enriching their already developed
   not-accessible ones with accessibility characteristics and so as to make
   them accessible.}},

Abstract = {{The need to study representative users is widely accepted within the
   human-computer interaction (HCI) community. While exceptions exist, and
   alternative populations are sometimes studied, virtually any
   introduction to the process of designing user interfaces will discuss
   the importance of understanding the intended users as well as the
   significant impact individual differences can have on how effectively
   individuals can use various technologies. HCI researchers are expected
   to provide relevant demographics regarding study participants as well as
   information about experience using similar technologies. Yet, in the
   field of accessibility we continue to see studies that do not
   appropriately include representative users. Highlighting ways to remedy
   this multifaceted problem, we argue that expectations regarding how
   accessibility research is conducted and reported must be raised if this
   field is to have the desired impact with regard to inclusive design, the
   information technologies studied, and the lives of the individuals being
   studied.}},

Abstract = {{Eye movements can be consciously controlled by humans to the extent of
   performing sequences of predefined movement patterns, or `gaze
   gestures'. Gaze gestures can be tracked non-invasively employing a
   video-based eye tracking system. Gaze gestures hold great potential in
   the context of Human Computer Interaction as low-cost gaze trackers
   become more ubiquitous. In this work, we build an original set of 50
   gaze gestures and evaluate the recognition performance of a Bayesian
   inference algorithm known as Hierarchical Temporal Memory, HTM. HTM uses
   a neocortically inspired hierarchical architecture and spatio-temporal
   coding to perform inference on multi-dimensional time series. Here, we
   show how an appropiate temporal codification is critical for good
   inference results. Our results highlight the potential of gaze gestures
   for the fields of accessibility and interaction with smartphones,
   projected displays and desktop computers.}},

Title = {{The Expertise Effect on Web Accessibility Evaluation Methods}},
Journal = {{HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{26}},

Pages = {{246-283}},
Abstract = {{Web accessibility means that disabled people can effectively perceive,
   understand, navigate, and interact with the web. Web accessibility
   evaluation methods are needed to validate the accessibility of web
   pages. However, the role of subjectivity and of expertise in such
   methods is unknown and has not previously been studied. This article
   investigates the effect of expertise in web accessibility evaluation
   methods by conducting a Barrier Walkthrough (BW) study with 19 expert
   and 57 nonexpert judges. The BW method is an evaluation method that can
   be used to manually assess the accessibility of web pages for different
   user groups such as motor impaired, low vision, blind, and mobile users.
   Our results show that expertise matters, and even though the effect of
   expertise varies depending on the metric used to measure quality, the
   level of expertise is an important factor in the quality of
   accessibility evaluation of web pages. In brief, when pages are
   evaluated with nonexperts, we observe a drop in validity and
   reliability. We also observe a negative monotonic relationship between
   number of judges and reproducibility: more evaluators mean more diverse
   outputs. After five experts, reproducibility stabilizes, but this is not
   the case with nonexperts. The ability to detect all the problems
   increases with the number of judges: With 3 experts all problems can be
   found, but for such a level 14 nonexperts are needed. Even though our
   data show that experts rated pages differently, the difference is quite
   small. Finally, compared to nonexperts, experts spent much less time and
   the variability among them is smaller, they were significantly more
   confident, and they rated themselves as being more productive. The
   article discusses practical implications regarding how BW results should
   be interpreted, how to recruit evaluators, and what happens when more
   than one evaluator is hired.
   Supplemental materials are available for this article. Go to the
   publisher's online edition of Human-Computer Interaction for statistical
   details and additional measures for this article.}},

   and to produce user interfaces out of these methods. This workshop is
   aimed at reviewing the state of the art of software support for a UIDL
   in the context of any development method (e.g., formal method,

Abstract = {{Accessibility is a growing concern in several research areas. In
   computer science, programs that provide accessibility are those that
   enable people with disabilities to use computing resources efficiently.
   Since virtual environment relies primarily on the visual mode, usually
   using writing content, it may seem that access for deaf people is not an
   issue. However, for prelingually deaf individuals, those who were deaf
   since before learn any language, written information is often of limited
   accessibility than if presented in signing. Further, for this community,
   signing is their language of choice, and reading text in a spoken
   language is akin to using a foreign language. Sign language uses
   gestures and facial expressions and is widely used by deaf communities.
   The aim of this work is to develop a 3D virtual agent for presenting
   sign language information. The avatar consists of an articulated model,
   representing a human character, which is able to articulate signs. The
   virtual agent control is done through text scripts that describe the
   signs in particular notation developed in the context of this work. A
   sign language 3D virtual agent provides important improvement in human
   computer interaction for deaf people, and may also be a tool for
   teaching and research of sign languages.}},

   students' and teachers' overall satisfaction and perceived performance,
   (b) the organization and management of learning, and (c) social
   interaction and collaboration between/among students and teachers. The
   results provide insights for important interaction design and

   e-learning content, student comprehension and satisfaction, skipping
   courses, cost-effective educational and time management, social
   awareness, collaboration, oflaming,o and oborder-crossing.o The study
   reports on issues that need to be considered by human-computer

Abstract = {{Interfaces represent the point of interaction between users and systems,
   defining their adaptability level in terms of usability and
   accessibility. These interfaces must advance in the same direction as
   the information society, where all objects of the world around us are
   being introduced like services to create the Internet of Things, and so,
   the Internet of The Future. Therefore, the new interfaces must guarantee
   that users have access to all information and functionality that the new
   Internet can provide. Those advances require a new develop interface
   concept where systems can create interfaces according to applications
   and users needs, always in a proactive form. In this way, the work
   presented in this paper tries to define a new semantic and architectural
   model to create intelligent and multi-device interface which may be
   adapted proactively according to the context and each users
   requirements.}},

Abstract = {{When we develop an input device for users to communicate with computers,
   we have to take into account that end-users must consider the
   utilization of the device to be effective, efficient and satisfactory.
   Users whose expectations are unmet by the interface will tend to abandon
   it. In this paper we present a vision-based interface for motor-impaired
   users; a multidisciplinary group developed this interface. The user's
   preferences are a critical issue when selecting an access device;
   therefore, user requirements should be included in the design. Usability
   evaluation should be integrated into relevant phases of software
   development. In order to evaluate the design, we present a process with
   multiple user studies at different development stages. We describe the
   combination of a development project and its implementation, with user
   experience considerations embedded in the process. Finally, we studied
   the performance of the interface through several tests, paying special
   attention to satisfaction and fatigue. From our results we observed that
   although several users found the interface tiring, their satisfaction
   level was encouraging, suggesting the interface is usable. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Using a psychotechnological perspective, this study discusses the
   current model of information ranking by search engines, based on
   quantitative Web Popularity (WP), which binds users to a cognitive
   adaptation to the rank-system restrictions. This phenomenon gives rise
   to a ``rich-get-richer'' effect on the Web. This paper claims that such
   an effect could be limited or reversed by the introduction of quality
   factors in ranking, and addresses the case of accessibility as a
   fundamental such factor. A study is reported which, through introducing
   an accessibility factor in a well-known popularity ranking algorithm,
   demonstrates that this transformation allows a qualitative
   rearrangement, without modifying or weighing on the properties of the
   rank. The overall approach is grounded on two development factors: the
   analysis of accessibility through specific tools and the employment of
   this analysis within all components used to build up the ranking. The
   results show that it is important to reconsider WP as including not only
   on the number of inbound and outbound links of a website, but also on
   its level of accessibility for all users, and on users' judgment of the
   website use as efficient, effective, and satisfactory.}},

Title = {{Worth-centred mobile phone design for older users}},
Journal = {{UNIVERSAL ACCESS IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{387-403}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The twenty-first century society fights against an inherent tendency to
   over-classify and label people. In the case of the aged, despite all
   efforts, the perception of the helpless, feeble older person still
   prevails. The truth of the matter is that people over sixty often do not
   fit this profile. The aged are a heterogeneous group with varying
   different skills and abilities in many different areas. This paper
   challenges prevalent mobile phone design decisions that appear to have
   been made based on the erroneous pre-conception of the incapable elder.
   Designers currently produce ``senior'' mobile phones that are, at best,
   inadequate and, at worst, insulting to a sector of society that deserves
   respect and consideration. Age does indeed influence mobile phone usage,
   and people over sixty often have specific and special needs, quite apart
   from age-related limitations, that predict their use of mobile phones.
   Most mobile phones designed for older users simply reduce the number of
   features: the so-called simplification approach. Apart from reducing the
   effectiveness of the phone, this approach often incorporates the fatal
   design flaw of using numbers or letters, on speed-dial buttons, which
   requires the user to remember the button-person mappings. In fact, this
   design rationale reduces the value of the phone to the user. This paper
   argues that mobile phone design for older users should be worth-centred
   (Cockton G in Designing worth is worth designing. In: Proceedings of the
   4th Nordic conference on human-computer interaction: changing roles.
   Oslo, Norway, pp 165-174, 2006) rather than simplification-driven. The
   worth-centred approach maximises worth to the user of the phone. This is
   achieved by maximising effectiveness while accommodating reduced
   capabilities. To maximise ease of use, and consequent accessibility,
   features may have to be reduced in an informed way. To facilitate this,
   a mapping process is proposed whereby user needs are linked to uses of
   the phone, and then to the features that facilitate these uses. Needs
   fall into a number of categories, and each category is characterised by
   a number of different uses, which form a usage space. Features can be
   linked to one or more usage spaces, and thus be used to support needs.
   The first step in the conducted research entailed the identification of
   the needs of the older mobile phone user. Then, it was determined
   whether these needs were indeed being met by the uses afforded in
   existing phones. Having concluded that most users' needs were not being
   met, the next step was to capture data on the needs, limitations and
   expectations of people over the age of sixty. This was achieved by
   conducting a series of one-to-one interviews with a number of older
   mobile phone users and also supervising a participatory design
   experiment. Using the findings of the analysis, a usage space model is
   proposed, which serves to align feature inclusion with user needs. Based
   on this usage space model (the theoretical contribution), a prototype
   mobile phone design is presented as the practical contribution of the
   paper.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes our approach for studying and prototyping
   human-environment interaction (HEI) within a pervasive space applied to

   facility for designers, developers and even end-users in defining and
   processing multimodal interaction. We underline the fact that the design
   of interaction for users with special needs do not have to be considered
   as orthogonal to the application but rather as a validation context
   which is the heart of our research laboratory activities. We have
   integrated our framework in demonstrator dedicated to people with
   disabilities to validate the concept. This paper will present the
   framework, the developed components of our HEI model and the prototype
   realised. The outcome of this research activity is to provide a
   multimodal processing framework to favour natural human pervasive
   environment by decreasing the cognitive workload necessary in a complex

Abstract = {{In this paper, a marker-free computer vision system for cognitive
   rehabilitation tests monitoring is presented. The system monitors and
   analyzes the correct and incorrect realization of a set of
   psicomotricity exercises in which a hand has to touch a facial feature.
   The monitoring requires different human body parts detection and
   tracking. Detection of face, eyes, nose, and hands is achieved with a
   set of classifiers built independently based on the AdaBoost algorithm.
   Comparisons with other detection approaches, regarding performance and
   applicability to the monitoring system, are presented. Face and hands
   tracking is accomplished through the CAMShift algorithm with independent
   and adaptive two-dimensional histograms of the chromaticity components
   of the TSL color space for the pixels inside these three regions. The
   TSL color space was selected after a study of five color spaces
   regarding skin color characterization. The system is easily implemented
   with a consumer-grade computer and a camera, unconstrained background
   and illumination and runs at more than 23 frames per second. The system
   was tested and achieved a successful monitoring percentage of 97.62\%.
   The automation of the human body parts motion monitoring, its analysis
   in relation to the psicomotricity exercise indicated to the patient and
   the storage of the result of the realization of a set of exercises free
   the rehabilitation experts of doing such demanding tasks. The
   vision-based system is potentially applicable to other human-computer
   interface tasks with minor changes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper illustrates how some of the human-computer interaction
   patterns associated with Web 2.0 can degrade the user experience of
   those with particular cognitive disabilities. It also shows how changes
   to computer technology often do not threaten accessibility directly and
   immediately, but, rather, indirectly, by spawning new user interaction
   patterns that compromise access. Web 2.0 interaction pattern
   technologies, such as mashups, dynamic page updates, social networking
   and user-created content demand specific perceptual abilities in
   addition to basic visual and auditory sensation. For example, computer
   users may have cognitive impairments that affect their abilities to
   group visual elements into patterns, recognize faces, build effective
   mental representations of perceptual or conceptual spaces, or retrieve
   linguistic representations during composition and comprehension. Because
   of these disabilities, they may find that certain forms of interaction
   associated with Web 2.0 diminish their access to this critical
   technology. Similarly, cognitive disabilities that disrupt social
   interactions may narrow users' participation in the socially intensive
   environment of Web 2.0. For areas of cognition that involve perception,
   social interaction, and critical supporting processes such as attention,
   the impact of Web 2.0 interaction patterns is discussed, suggesting
   potential solutions, design guidelines and research needs. The
   identification and description of the ways particular cognitive
   disabilities limit access to technology, particularly within the context
   of new, recently invented patterns of user interaction, underscores the
   need to extend Web design and development guidelines beyond the domains
   of sensory and movement disabilities. Designers and developers should
   learn to recognize how the different ways people think, learn, perceive,
   or plan can jeopardize access to computers in the same fashion as do the
   different ways they see, hear, or move.}},

Abstract = {{This communication reports on the results of a web accessibility audit
   of public Web sites in Greece. The audit was conducted in 2008 by the
   Human Computer Interaction Laboratory of the Institute of Computer
   Science of FORTH, in its capacity as the Greek National Contact Centre
   of the European Design for All e-Accessibility Network. In an earlier
   e-Accessibility study in 2004, that evaluated approximately 250 public
   and commercial Web sites in Greece, 73\% of the sample failed to meet
   the most basic requirements for web accessibility
   (http://www.infosoc.gr/NR/rdonlyres/0B306F9C-A819-4F96-ABB1-A21945D1D2B3
   /1092/final\_report.pdf). Four years later, in the context of a
   re-audit, a similar sample was examined for compliance with the same web
   accessibility standard (WCAG 1.0), as set by the Web Accessibility
   Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium. The accessibility checks
   were conducted during the period from March to September 2008. A
   comparison of the results indicates that although new web development
   technologies may have been employed, instead of improving the overall
   status of e-accessibility, this has resulted in a serious deterioration
   in overall accessibility levels. Such findings-85\% of sites failed to
   comply with Level A-suggest that Greek Web sites are likely to present
   even more significant access barriers to people with disability than in
   the past. As Web Accessibility is poorly understood and, until today,
   new platforms have failed to deliver products that conform to WCAG, the
   need emerges for a concrete legislative framework to set accessibility
   specifications for all public Web sites in Greece.}},

   with previous findings, presenting task information proactively during

Abstract = {{Routine computer tasks are often difficult for older adult computer
   users to learn and remember. People tend to learn new tasks by relating
   new concepts to existing knowledge. However, even for `basic' computer
   tasks there is little, if any, existing knowledge on which older adults
   can base their learning. This paper investigates a custom file
   management interface that was designed to aid discovery and learnability
   by providing interface objects that are familiar to the user. A study
   was conducted which examined the differences between older and younger
   computer users when undertaking routine file management tasks using the
   standard Windows desktop as compared with the custom interface. Results
   showed that older adult computer users requested help more than ten
   times as often as younger users when using a standard windows/mouse
   configuration, made more mistakes and also required significantly more
   confirmations than younger users. The custom interface showed
   improvements over standard Windows/mouse, with fewer confirmations and
   less help being required. Hence, there is potential for an interface
   that closely mimics the real world to improve computer accessibility for
   older adults, aiding self-discovery and learnability.}},

Abstract = {{Multimedia resources are an important tool that can be used by teachers
   in the classroom as a learning aid for learners with disabilities or by
   parents and children at home. However, disabled children are not always
   able to use existing assistive technologies because they are not
   experienced enough, suffer from medium/profound disability, or simply do
   not have the financial resources to buy commercial tools. Additionally,
   today's adapted tools are not always valid for a broad spectrum of
   disabled users and often focus on a user group. We claim that potential
   applications and resources for people with special needs must self-adapt
   to user capabilities and skills, reducing the use of external assistive
   technologies. In this paper, we present a guide for developers to create
   accessible applications and resources that reduce workload.}},

   Interpreter Module (SLI Module). The improvement in comparison to

   has a transparent background and is shown over the existing web page.
   The end user can activate the video playback by clicking on an
   interactive icon. The mechanism also provides a simplified approach to
   enable accessibility requirements of existing web pages. In addition,
   the subtitles are stored externally in the Timed Text Authoring Format
   (TTAF), which is a candidate for recommendation by the W3C community.
   Empirical results from our evaluation study showed that the prototype

Abstract = {{The ever increasing diversification of Web services and software
   applications poses a real challenge to developers and designers when
   creating software that has to cope with a myriad of interaction
   situations, as well as specific directives for ensuring an accessible
   interaction. Utilizing an advanced web services accessibility assessment
   tool, they can obtain a better understanding of the accessibility
   constraints for people with disabilities within Web services and
   software application's user interfaces. The proposed Web services
   assessment tool will assist them, with a minimal effort, to explore
   user-centered design and important accessibility issues for their
   software implementations. In an effort to solve such issues, this paper
   takes a step forward and introduces the notion of accessibility in the
   web service domain, in order to enhance web services with accessibility
   features capable to ensure that HCI through applications utilizing them
   is accessible.}},

Abstract = {{The development of interactive visual applications is a complex work,
   usually performed with the help of advanced visual programming
   environments. Starting from the GUI's visual specifications, the
   programming environment generates the corresponding code that implements
   the interface. In most cases, designers and developers have no tools to
   keep control over the usability and the maintainability of the resulting
   applications. In fact, the success of an information system depends on
   the accessibility and usability of its interface. The evaluation of
   visual environments is traditionally performed by means of expert-based
   evaluations or by testing with end users. In this paper, we describe a
   methodology to design, specify and evaluate interactive visual
   applications, based on the SR-Action Grammars formalism. We describe how
   it is possible to assess the usability metrics of consistency,
   completeness and user control by means of checks performed at high
   abstraction level of the visual language. In particular, we improve the
   formalism of the SR-Action Grammars (Cassino et al. (2003): SR-Task
   Grammars: A Formal Specification of Human Computer Interaction for
   Interactive Visual Languages 2003 Symposium on Visual Languages and
   Formal Methods (VLFM `03) - IEEE Symposia on Human-Centric Computing
   Languages and Environments (HCC'03)) to specify visual languages, so to
   perform usability checks by the management of the production rules.
   TAGIVE (Cassino et al. (2006): A Methodology for Computer Supported
   Development of Interactive Visual Applications - WSEAS Transactions On
   Information Science and Applications Journal.) is the tool that allows
   to design interactive visual environments and to generate the related
   formal specification in automatic manner. Thanks to the controls
   performed at formal level, the system guides the designer in the correct
   development of the application.}},

Abstract = {{In the design of computer systems, human diversity and their specific
   needs have been neglected in the past, possibly because engineers were
   developing products for end users who were very much like themselves.
   The large impact that computer systems have nowadays on the increasing
   number of different users brings to consider traditional Human-Computer
   Interaction topics, such as user-centered design, usability engineering,
   accessibility, information visualization, very important also for
   Information Systems, since they influence technology usage in business,
   managerial, organizational and cultural contexts. People would like
   computer systems that can be tailored to their individual needs and
   working practices. To this aim, systems must be developed whose user
   interfaces is flexible, i.e., it permits end users to modify or add new
   functionalities, still being simple and easy to use, not requiring any
   programming knowledge. In this paper, we discuss an approach that gives
   end users the possibility to tailor presentation as well as
   functionalities of the system they use, thus supporting users to
   participate in the design of their tools.}},

   standard Geneva Emotional Wheel developed by Klaus Scherer and a novel
   temporal characteristic description feature, is aiming towards enabling
   the annotator to label expressions recorded in human computer
   interaction scenarios on an utterance level. Further, it is respecting
   key features of realistic and natural emotional expressions, such as
   their sequentiality, temporal characteristics, their mixed occurrences,
   and their expressivity or clarity of perception. Additionally, first
   steps towards evaluating the proposed tool, by analyzing utterance
   annotations taken from two expressive speech corpora, are undertaken and
   some future goals including the open source accessibility of the tool

Abstract = {{Presenting Web content through screen readers can be a challenging task,
   but this is the only means of access for many blind and visually
   impaired users. The difficulties are more acute when the information
   forms part of an interactive process, such as the increasingly common
   oWeb 2.0 applicationso. If the process is to be completed correctly and
   efficiently it is vital that appropriate information is given to the
   user at an appropriate time. Designing a non-visual interface that
   achieves these aims is a non-trivial task, for which several approaches
   are possible. The one taken here is to use eye-tracking to understand
   how sighted users interact with the content, and to gain insight into
   how they benefit from the information, then apply this understanding to
   design a non-visual user interface. This paper describes how this
   technique was applied to develop audio interfaces for two common types
   of interactionauto-suggest lists and pop-up calendars. Although the
   resulting interfaces were quite different, one largely mirroring the
   visual representation and the other not, evaluations showed that the
   approach was effective, with both audio implementations effective and
   popular with participants.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an advanced call center, which adapts presentation
   and interaction strategy to properties of the caller such as age,
   gender, and emotional state. User studies on interactive voice response
   (IVR) systems have shown that these properties can be used effectively
   to ``tailor{''} services to users or user groups who do not maintain
   personal preferences, e. g., because they do not use the service on a
   regular basis. The adopted approach to achieve individualization of
   services, without being able to personalize them, is based on the
   analysis of a caller's voice. This paper shows how this approach
   benefits service providers by being able to target entertainment and
   recommendation options. It also shows how this analysis at the same time
   benefits the customer, as it can increase accessibility of IVR systems
   to user segments which have particular expectations or which do not cope
   well with a ``one size fits all{''} system. The paper summarizes the
   authors' current work on component technologies, such as emotion
   detection, age and gender recognition on telephony speech, and presents
   results of usability and acceptability tests as well as an architecture
   to integrate these technologies in future multi-modal contact centers.
   It is envisioned that these will eventually serve customers with an
   avatar representation of an agent and tailored interaction strategies,
   matching powerful output capabilities with advanced analysis of the
   user's input.}},

Abstract = {{On-line learning is an asynchronous computer-based learning mode that
   allows learners to learn anytime and anywhere in their own environment
   using information and communication technology. It can be considered as
   a way to bridge the digital gap. How a computer novice performs in such
   virtual and asynchronous learning environments is an interesting issue
   in human-computer interaction research. This paper presents the results
   of a study to investigate on-line learning performance and computer
   anxiety for unemployed adult novices. In this study, we propose a novel
   idea that integrates the concept of Shannon entropy into a grey
   relational analysis model. The proposed method was used to measure human
   information behavior in relation to on-line learning performance and
   computer anxiety. A total of 115 unemployed adults voluntarily
   participated in the experimental study. All experimental subjects were
   divided into groups according to individual differences in gender, age
   ranges, educational levels, and learning performances. Taking advantage
   of the grey relation entropy operation, we derived the perceptive
   correlations among different classified groups in terms of the
   accessibility of on-line learning and computer anxiety scales,
   respectively. Through the empirical study, certain on-line learning
   characteristics were also identified. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to design and evaluate new dynamic
   text-editing methods (chatting, instant messenger) using a foot pedal
   control. A first experiment was to assess whether the foot-based method
   enhanced editing performance compared to conventional mouse use and to
   identify which type of foot control is most convenient for users. Five
   prototype methods including four new methods (two pedals or one pedal. 0
   order or 1st order control), and one mouse method were developed and
   tested by performing a task requiring changing text sizes, dynamically.
   Results revealed methods involving 1st order pedal control to be
   comparable to the conventional method in task completion time, accuracy
   and subjective workload. Among the four foot control prototypes, two
   pedals with 1st order control was superior to in performance. A second
   experiment was conducted to test another prototype foot-based method for
   controlling font face, size, and color through feature selection with
   the left pedal and level selection with the right pedal. Text-editing
   performance was compared to conventional mouse-based editing. Results
   showed the foot pedals to degrade performance in terms of task
   completion time. However, the prototype interface has the advantage of
   making certain system functionality accessible to special populations
   that might not otherwise be able to use dynamic text-editing
   applications. Subjective comments demonstrated the foot pedal methods to
   be considered useful, time efficient and to reduce workload. it was
   observed that skilled users might perceive some relief from cumbersome
   mouse handling behaviors during typing. Although the foot pedal control
   was not revealed to significantly increase text-editing performance over
   conventional mousing, the use of foot pedals may be considered in
   computing operations, including dynamic text-editing tasks, as an
   alternative or additional input method, particularly for special
   populations.
   Relevance to industry: The development and evaluation of foot control
   interaction methods for text editing may provide useful insight for
   human-computer system designers considering the use of additional input
   devices or ways to support user expressions of emotion in text. The foot
   control approach may also be useful in interaction design for special
   populations (with functional limitations of the upper limbs) in terms of
   accessibility. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sketching user interface and virtual reality (VR) techniques to
   education application has become popular, promising to make the teaching
   and learning experience more natural and efficient for users. The
   adaptive support can improve the intelligence during the interaction
   process between user and systems to emphasize the individual needs. In
   this paper, we present the sketching user interface for geometry
   teaching and the VR class integrated with the corresponding adaptation
   support, which meet the requirements for the education application.
   Furthermore, we analylze the sketch context for adaptive mechanism in
   the education system with an instance. Finally, a prototype based on the
   methods above is developed An informal study is also done to show that
   it enhances the accessibility and individualization during the process
   of teaching and learning and helps to enhance user experience in human
   computer interaction.}},

   (DD) and we pay a special attention to its relation with disabled
   people. We emphasise on the importance of the fight against the DD and
   we report a number of projects that aim to reduce it in Catalonia
   (Spain). The main contribution of this work is the study of the DD from
   the point of view of the relation between Information and Communication
   Technologies (ICTs) and disabled people. We analyse the problems that
   disabled people have to face in order to use ICTs. Therefore, we have
   defined a number of measures to determine the degree of accessibility
   that a given user has and we have carried out some experiments to
   evaluate the proposed measures. Our work is deeply related with the
   Omnia Project and the telecentres network impelled by the Catalan
   Government. Thus, we must understand Our work in the context of these
   innovative initiatives. In this chapter we concentrate oil the
   Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) issues related to the DD in order to
   explain our experience in this field. At the time of writing this text,
   the experimental part is still in progress, however some previous
   results are given. Moreover the current work and experiences are also

   plans, metrics and heuristics. There is an obvious tension between these

   towards improvisations, diversity, and ever-changing affordances. The
   parallel evolution of human computer interaction (HCI) has been
   characterized as three waves, each building on the previous one,
   resulting in an in-depth understanding of the interwoven activity of
   humans and non-humans (artifacts). Now when facing the era of mixed
   reality, accessibility can gain considerably from HCI's, usability's and
   interaction design's bodies of knowledge.}},

   Usability evaluation reflects the impact of the interface and the

   unfolds the perspective to the usability integration in the spoken

   for creating and testing usable content and applications for
   conversational interfaces. Main concerns include the problem
   identification of design issues for usability design and evaluation, the
   use of customer experience for the design of voice interfaces and
   dialogue, and the problems that arise from real-life deployment.
   Moreover it presents a real-life paradigm of a hands-on approach for
   applying usability methodologies in a spoken dialogue application
   environment to compare against a DTMF approach. Finally, the scope and
   interpretation of results from both the designer and the user standpoint

   and implicit interaction, elaboration of design methods suitable for
   very complex interactive environments, and mechanisms for interaction
   adaptation. This article argues that such challenges in the context of
   AmI environments can be addressed by systematically investigating the
   interplay between the user, the context, and the technologies. Such a
   research direction requires systematic approaches to diverse human
   needs, dynamic context characteristics, and technology possibilities,
   all of which need to be elaborated and validated in practice.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous advances on diagnostic techniques based on medical images, as
   well as the incorporation of new techniques in surgical instruments are
   progressively changing the new surgical procedures. Also, new minimally
   invasive techniques, which are currently highly consolidated, have
   produced significant advances, both from the technological and from the
   surgical treatment perspectives. The limitations that the manual
   realization of surgical interventions implies, in what refers to
   precision and accessibility, can be tackled with the help of robotics.
   In the same way, sensor based robot control techniques are opening new
   possibilities for the introduction of more improvements in these
   procedures, either relying on teleoperation, in which the surgeon and
   the robot establish their best synergy to get the optimal results, or by
   means of the automation of some specific actions or tasks. In this
   article the effect of robotics in the evolution of surgical techniques
   is described. Starting with a review of the robotics application fields,
   the article continues analyzing the methods and technologies involved in
   the process of robotizing surgical procedures, as well as the

   Such as those with major psychomotor or cognitive impairments. However,
   there are many more for whom the BCI would be an attractive option given
   an acceptable learning overhead, including less severe disabilities and
   safety critical conditions where cognitive overload or limited responses
   are likely. Recent progress has been modest as there are many technical
   and accessibility problems to overcome. We present these issues and

Abstract = {{Physically disabled and mentally challenged people are an important part
   of our society that has not yet received the same opportunities as
   others in their inclusion in the Information Society. Therefore, it is
   necessary to develop easily accessible systems for computers to achieve
   their inclusion within the new technologies. This paper presents a
   project whose objective is to draw disabled people nearer to new
   technologies. It presents a vision-based user interface designed to
   achieve computer accessibility for disabled users with motor
   impairments. The interface automatically finds the user's face and
   tracks it through time to recognize gestures within the face region in
   real time. Subsequently, a new information fusion procedure is proposed
   to acquire data from computer vision algorithms and its results are used
   to carry out a robust recognition process. Finally, we show how the
   system is used to replace a conventional mouse device for computer
   interaction and as a communication system for non-verbal children. (C)

Abstract = {{Industrialized countries are faced with severe demographical and social
   changes. Consequently, areas including Ambient Assisted Living are of
   increasing importance. The vision is to provide technologies for
   supporting (elderly) people in their daily lives, allowing them to stay
   longer within their own home aiming at living independent and
   self-determined. User Interfaces in such systems are mostly multimodal,
   because standard interfaces have limited accessibility. Multimodal user
   interfaces combine various input and output modalities (including
   seeing/vision, hearing/audition, haptic/tactile, taste/gustation,
   smell/olfaction etc) which are classical research areas in
   Human-Computer Interaction (HCl) and Usability Engineering (UE). One of
   the advantages of multiple modalities is increased usability: the
   weaknesses of one modality are offset by the strengths of another. For
   example, on a mobile device with a small visual interface and keypad, a
   word may be quite difficult to read/type, however very easy to
   say/listen. Such interfaces, in combination with mobile technologies,
   can have tremendous implications for accessibility and can be a benefit
   for people. An important issue is that interfaces must be accessible,
   useful and usable. Traditionally, HCl bridges Psychology, Pedagogy and
   Informatics, while UE is anchored in software technology. Together,
   HCl\&UE provide the emerging potential to assist the daily workflows in
   the realm of AAL. This special thematic session is devoted to promote a
   closer collaboration between Psychologists, Pedagogues and Computer
   Scientists.}},

   Large portion of Internet advances owes the human-computer interaction
   and data exchange via web forms. The current complex Internet
   applications are not easy to use for people with cognitive impairments
   and they usually use the Internet as a publication platform. To change
   this state. the web forms, as the basic block of Internet applications,
   should be made accessible for people with varying levels of cognitive
   abilities. especially for severely challenged users in this category.
   New technologies such as the Semantic Web and XForms can be combined to
   make the Web applications more accessible for these people. In this
   short paper, the possible application of XForms in combination with the
   Semantic Web technology is explored and a solution model for providing
   accessibility for people with cognitive impairments is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the overlapping scope and aims of web-usability and
   web-accessibility (such as problems in Using the web and the barriers in
   accessing the web) threre are only few Studies which analyse the
   connections between the two areas. The present study investigates the
   relationship between web-accessibility and web-usability. To analyse
   this relationship we have designed an online test environment. We
   developed three complete internet presences (testportals), each one with
   a different level of accessibility. 13 1 test users were recruited
   viewed these three testportals and rated their usability. The instrument
   to evaluate usability was an especially modified and reduced version of
   the Web Usability Index (WUI) which was made available online in the
   form of a questionnaire. The central question this study Sought to
   answer was: is there a difference in the usability ratings between
   websites with different levels of accessibility? The findings resulting
   from the central question were clear. The mean values show it
   significant difference in the usability ratings of the three portals.
   Other question Our study sought to answer were the influences of the
   disability and the age factors. These influences are partly significant.}},

   Games, considered as a field of research, could provide new interaction
   principles, which call be incorporated into the existing HCI Standards,
   thereby complimenting and expanding these standards positively. However,
   games also provide an interesting new potential for better access and
   for supporting people with disabilities. They can be used to acclimatize
   people. who have had little or no exposure to technology, to interaction
   with modern Information and Computer Technology (ICT). Sonic simulation
   games act as an interface between games playing and real life, where the

   communication systems. It is important to ensure that everyone has
   accessibility to this technology, regardless of abilities or age. This

Abstract = {{The development, analysis and follow-up of the processes designed to
   assure the usability and accessibility of websites is a tedious work for
   the moderator or evaluator. This is why there is a necessity for tools
   that can automate the processes. There are some tools that cover some of
   the technical aspects, but no tools have been identified that can tackle
   the process as a whole. For these reasons the Aragonese Usability
   Laboratory decided to develop WebA (Web Analysis), with the objective to
   have a complete application. This application is designed through
   modules with the objective of covering all of the evaluation and
   analysis phases, and it concludes with a process management module. For
   the analysis phase a Card Sorting module (open \& closed) has been
   developed that uses the hierarchical and multidimensional cluster
   analysis, which allows a better information architecture. For the
   evaluation phases, modules have been developed that allow the
   semiautomatic evaluation of usability through user satisfaction tests
   based on Nielsen heuristics and ISO standards, the evaluation of
   accessibility through the verification of WCAG 1.0 guidelines. The
   application concludes with a process design and evaluation management
   module, and modules that automatically generate the reports of the
   analysis carried out.}},

Abstract = {{The ``universal accessibility{''} concept is acquiring an important role
   in the research area of human-computer interaction (HCI). This
   phenomenon is guided by the need to simplify the access to technological
   devices, such as mobile phones, PDAs and portable PCs, by making
   human-computer interaction more similar to human-human communication. In
   this direction, multimodal interaction has emerged as a new paradigm of
   human-computer interaction, which advances the implementation of
   universal accessibility. The main challenge of multimodal interaction,
   that is also the main topic of this paper, lies in developing a
   framework that is able to acquire information derived from whatever
   input modalities, to give these inputs an appropriate representation
   with a common meaning, to integrate these individual representations
   into a joint semantic interpretation, and to understand which is the
   better way to react to the interpreted multimodal sentence by activating
   the appropriate output devices. A detailed description of this framework
   and its functionalities will be given in this paper, along with some
   preliminary application details.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropomorphism describes the tendency to imbue the real or imagined
   behavior of nonhuman agents with humanlike characteristics, motivations,
   intentions, or emotions. Although surprisingly common, anthropomorphism
   is not invariant. This article describes a theory to explain when people
   are likely to anthropomorphize and when they are not, focused on three
   psychological determinants-the accessibility and applicability of
   anthropocentric knowledge (elicited agent knowledge), the motivation to
   explain and understand the behavior of other agents (effectance
   motivation), and the desire for social contact and affiliation
   (sociality motivation). This theory predicts that people are more likely
   to anthropomorphize when anthropocentric knowledge is accessible and
   applicable, when motivated to be effective social agents, and when
   lacking a sense of social connection to other humans. These factors help
   to explain why anthropomorphism is so variable; organize diverse
   research; and offer testable predictions about dispositional,
   situational, developmental, and cultural influences on anthropomorphism.
   Discussion addresses extensions of this theory into the specific
   psychological processes underlying anthropomorphism, applications of
   this theory into robotics and human-computer interaction, and the
   insights offered by this theory into the inverse process of
   dehumanization.}},

Abstract = {{The application of information technology (IT) to issues of healthcare
   delivery has had a long and tortuous history in the United States.
   Within the field of eHealth, vanguard applications of advanced computing
   techniques, such as applications in artificial intelligence or expert
   systems, have languished in spite of a track record of scholarly
   publication and decisional accuracy. The problem is one of purpose, of
   asking the right questions for the science to solve. Historically, many
   computer science pioneers have been tempted to ask `' what can the
   computer do?'' New advances in eHealth are prompting developers to ask
   14 what can people do?'' How can eHealth take part in national goals for
   healthcare reform to empower relationships between healthcare
   professionals and patients, healthcare teams and families, and hospitals
   and communities to improve health equitably throughout the population?
   To do this, eHealth researchers must combine best evidence from the user
   sciences (human factors engineering, human-computer interaction,
   psychology, and usability) with best evidence in medicine to create
   transformational improvements in the quality of care that medicine
   offers. These improvements should follow recommendations from the
   Institute of Medicine to create a healthcare system that is (1) safe,
   (2) effective (evidence based), (3) patient centered, and (4) timely.
   Relying on the eHealth researcher's intuitive grasp of systems issues,
   improvements should be made with considerations of users and
   beneficiaries at the individual (patient-physician), group
   (family-staff), community, and broad environmental levels.}},

Abstract = {{In the internet age, citizens' interaction with the government needs to
   take place with comfort and convenience. The citizens' interaction
   happens in government offices to get information and services. This
   leads to loss of money, time and also of opportunity. Citizens need
   information and effective e-governance services delivered at one place.
   The government should visualize the need of citizens and put all
   services and information at one stop and focus on mechanisms of
   e-governance kiosk service delivery. The indicators like kiosk's
   accessibility, participation in e-Governance and awareness of
   e-governance that were found to be significant for the success of good
   governance and play a critical role for implementing the e-governance
   projects to provide e-services to citizens through kiosk. Since late
   2000, in the tribal region of Tikamgarh District in Madhya Pradesh,
   TARAhaat has tried to make government services and information
   accessible to rural masses through information and communication
   technology. This research paper examines the predictors of good
   governance (effective service delivery) good governance analysis through
   questionnaire-based survey. The survey was mainly confined to rural
   areas and Orchha village of Niwari tehsil, District Tikamgarh of Madhya
   Pradesh, India. The sample frame consisted of total 450 respondents. A
   final valid sample of only 173 out of 450 (38\% success rate) was
   obtained and used in the analysis. Rural citizens have realized the
   potential benefits of e-governance. This paper concludes that citizens'
   participation, in E-governance, awareness of E-governance and physical
   Accessibility of Kiosk have positive impact on their lives. All
   stakeholders' active participation would achieve more by building
   collaborative effort rather than individual contributions of the
   institutions working in isolation to make good governance possible.
   Human computer interface should be effective, efficient, intuitive and
   pleasing. This is an essential interface between technology and human
   for ensuring meaningful transfer of information.}},

Abstract = {{Applications for blind users often involve the mapping of information
   such as size (magnitude) from one sensory domain (vision) onto another
   (sound or touch). For example, visual perception of length can be
   estimated directly by touch, or encoded to pitch or even vibration.
   Applications for blind users will benefit from fundamental research into
   human perception of computer-generated substitutions for vision. In this
   paper we present the results of a haptics-only experiment with the
   PHANToM that measures human performance (time and accuracy) judging
   relative magnitude with computer generated haptic properties. Magnitude
   was represented by either physical length (displacement), or vibration
   varied by frequency or amplitude. Eleven blind and eleven blindfolded
   sighted individuals participated. Displacement tasks were 50\% slower
   than vibration conditions for all participants. Accuracy for
   displacement and vibration varied by amplitude was equivalent. Vibration
   varied by frequency was significantly less accurate, although we are
   cautious about the reliability of those results. Blind participants took
   50\% longer with equivalent accuracy to sighted participants.
   Sightedness had no effect on performance regarding the type of display.
   No other interaction effects were found. These results suggest that
   vibration varied by amplitude provides a faster and equally accurate
   display of magnitude compared with the traditional displacement
   approach, Secondly, the same coding benefits equally well visually
   disabled and sighted individuals.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1953-1971}},
Abstract = {{Formal modelling techniques that employ principles of finite state
   automata have been increasingly used for shop-floor control. These
   approaches have focused primarily on unmanned systems where the
   self-contained logic for control of the systems is embedded within the
   model(s). To date, human operators are seldom configured within the
   modelling detail required for these systems. The result has been that
   the interface of humans within automatic systems has been limited. In
   general, humans performing physical activities in an automatic system
   must mimic the detailed responses normally transmitted via control
   computers and equipment, making the human interaction painful and prone
   to error. This paper discusses (1) the formal modelling specifics
   required for the control of such an automated shop floor system; and (2)
   the role and interactions of the human primarily in automatic systems.
   The human in the automatic manufacturing system addressed here serves
   primarily as a material handler and material transporter, providing
   almost unlimited possibilities regarding the accessibility of product
   flow from any system resource to any other system resource-a major
   constraint in many operational systems. The impact on the complexity of
   the accessibility graph, issues related to automatically controlling
   such a system and the human interactions within such a system are also
   developed. The paper introduces many complex issues and interactions,
   and concludes with an example of how a human handler can be effectively
   included in a finite state automaton.}},

Abstract = {{Network EducationWare (NEW) is a powerful and robust open-source
   multimedia system for synchronous Internet distance education. It
   supports blended presentations in a form we call simulteaching, where
   Some Students are in a traditional classroom and others participate in
   real time over the Internet. It also records the class as presented, so
   that students can attend class delayed in time. NEW has been designed to
   be highly modular and to make effective use of both network bandwidth
   and human time. Reference {[}1] describes how George Mason University
   has used NEW to offer a popular and innovative MS degree in Computer
   Science, at low cost.
   NEW consists of multi-platform, open source software that runs on
   inexpensive Windows and Linux computers. It implements both synchronous
   and asynchronous paradigms for distance education in a way that requires
   little additional effort on the part of the instructor and little
   additional cost for the institution, yet provides greatly increased
   accessibility to students and therefore promotes wider access to
   graduate computer science education.
   NEW is freely available to the Computer Science education community.
   Some important features which make it attractive are:
   Works over dialup modern and most commercial Internet services, allowing
   live participation, record, and playback at any site.
   Provides access to students at home or office, even through firewalls
   and network address translation (NAT) systems.
   Features Web-based access with LDAP authentication and an open source
   course management database.
   Audio and whiteboard interfaces with floor control and text chat panel
   allow full interaction with students over the Internet and require
   minimal learning time for faculty (video also is available with
   broadband Internet).
   Supports authoring of graphic materials from any application.
   Web-based Course Management system simplifies teaching, learning, and
   administration.
   This demonstration will feature the NEW clients for both Windows and
   Linux, in operation with the NEW Live and Playback servers over a local
   wireless network (see figure below for operational configuration). The
   NEW software will be available during the demonstration for installation
   and operation on attendees' laptop computers.}},

   compare the speed and accuracy of text entry with point-and-click input
   method between the matrix on-screen keyboard and the Windows XP QWERTY
   virtual keyboard. Data analysis revealed that the matrix on-screen
   keyboard provided better performance for the participant. The result
   also indicates that layout adaptation assessment is a valid tool to
   confirm proper layout size for users and that alphabetic order is better
   than QWERTY order for a novice user to learn a new on-screen keyboard. A
   usability study was undertaken to evaluation the performance of the
   double click instead of the point-and-click plus Shift key input method.

   objective is to vindicate the adoption of the Universal Accessibility
   paradigm in the design of main stream applications. Given that the
   authors think that current technology and design methods and tools are
   mature enough for inclusive design, they studied the conditions for its
   full deployment and propose the elimination of the found obstacles. In
   this paper, after justifying the importance of the Design for All, the
   main restrictions to inclusive design are reviewed and the need for a
   user oriented approach is showed. Other crucial matters to ensure
   inclusive design, such as user full participation and ethical and social
   impact avoidance, are analyzed. To finish, the role of the Assistive
   technology, in relation to Design for All is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The development of IP-Telephony in recent years has been substantial.
   The improvement in voice quality, the integration between voice and
   data, especially the interaction with multimedia has made the 3G
   communication more promising. The value added services of Telephony
   techniques alleviate the dependence on the phone and provide a universal
   platform for the multimodal telephony applications. For example, the
   web-based application with VoiceXML has been developed to simplify the
   human-machine interaction because it takes the advantage of the
   speech-enabled services and makes the telephone-web access a reality.
   However, it is not cost-efficient to build voice only stand-alone
   web-application and is more reasonable that voice interfaces should be
   retrofitted to be compatible or collaborate with the existing HTML or
   XML-based web applications. Therefore, this paper considers that the
   functionality of the web service should enable multiple access
   modalities so that users can perceive and interact with the site in
   either visual or speech response simultaneously. Under this principle,
   our research develops a prototype system of multimodal VoIP with the
   integrated web-based Mandarin dialog system which adopts automatic
   speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), VoiceXML browser, and
   VolP technologies to create user friendly graphic user interface (GUI)
   and voice user interface (VUI). The users can use traditional telephone,
   cellular phone, or even VoIP connection via personal computer to
   interact with the VoiceXML server. In the mean time, the users browse
   the web and access the same content with common HTML or XML-based
   browser. The proposed system shows excellent performance and can be
   easily incorporated into voice ordering service for a wider
   accessibility. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study looks at the preliminary development and evaluation of an
   icon-based ATM interface for use with functionally illiterate bank
   account holders. In the first part of the study functionally illiterate
   bank account holders were closely involved in the development of an icon
   set for the entire ATM withdrawal transaction. This involved target
   subjects providing descriptive information on possible icons and then
   evaluating these descriptions using an icon identification test.
   Although only seven of the 15 icons met the ISO criterion of 67\%
   correct identification, the `best' icons for each instruction were
   evaluated using one of three prototype interfaces-icon-only, text-only
   and text-and-icon interface. Comparisons were made between these three
   interfaces, and a functionally illiterate group and a comparison
   literate group. Results suggested that within each group there were few
   significant differences based on the type of interface, although there
   were significant differences between the groups. Significant differences
   in the literate group were primarily due to prior exposure to similar
   ATM interfaces, whereas significant differences in the illiterate group
   were primarily due to icon comprehensibility.}},

Abstract = {{Standard Interfaces have limited accessibility. Multimodal user
   interfaces combine various input and output modalities (including
   seeing/vision, hearing/audition, haptic/tactile, taste/gustation,
   smell/olfaction etc.), which are a classical research area in
   Human-Computer Interaction. One of the advantages of multiple modalities
   is increased flexibility in Usability. The weaknesses of one modality
   are offset by the strengths of another. For example, on a mobile device
   with a small visual interface and keypad, a word may be quite difficult
   to read/type, however very easy to say/listen. Such interfaces, in
   combination with mobile technologies, can have tremendous implications
   for accessibility and consequently, they are a potential benefit for
   people with a wide variety of impairments. Multimodal interfaces must be
   designed and developed exactly to fit the needs, requirements, abilities
   and different knowledge levels of the targeted end-users. It is also
   important to consider different contexts of use. However, in order to
   achieve advances in both research and development of such interfaces, it
   is essential to bring researchers and practitioners from Psychology and
   Computer Science together.}},

Abstract = {{In order to support the residual communication capabilities of verbal
   impaired peoples softwares allowing Augmentative and Alternative
   Communication (AAC) have been developed. AAC communication software aids
   provide verbal disables with an electronic table of AAC languages (i.e.
   Bliss, PCS, PIC, etc.) symbols in order to compose messages, exchange
   them via email, or vocally synthetize them, and so on. A current open
   issue, in thins kind of software, regards human-computer interaction in
   verbal impaired people suffering motor disorders. They can adopt only
   ad-hoc input device. such as buttons or switches, which require an
   intelligent automatic scansion of the AAC symbols table in order to
   compose messages. In such perspective we have developed CABA(2) L an
   innovative composition assistant exploiting an user linguistic behavior
   model adopting a semantic/probabilistic approach for predictive Bliss
   symbols scansion. CABA(2)L is based on an original discrete
   implementation of auto-regressive hidden Markov model called DAR-HMM and
   it is able to predict a list of symbols as the most probable ones
   according to both the previous selected symbol and the semantic
   categories associated to the symbols. We have implemented the
   composition assistant as a component of BLISS2003 an AAC communication
   software centered on Bliss language and experimentally validated it with
   both synthetic and real data.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays accessibility to new technologies for everyone is a task to
   accomplish. A way to contribute to this aim is creating new interfaces
   based on computer vision using low cost devices such as webcams. In this
   paper a face-based perceptual user interface is presented. Our approach
   is divided in four steps: automatic face detection, best face features
   detection, feature tracking and face gesture recognition. Using facial
   feature tracking and face gesture recognition it is possible to replace
   the mouse's motion and its events. This goal implies the restriction of
   real-time response and the use of unconstrained environments. Finally,
   this application has been tested successfully on disabled people with
   problems in hands or arms that can not use the traditional interfaces
   such as a mouse or a keyboard.}},

Abstract = {{The grid has the potential to transform collaborative scientific
   investigations through the use of closely coupled computational and
   visualization resources, which may be geographically distributed, in
   order to harness greater power than is available at a single site.
   Scientific applications to benefit from the grid include visualization,
   computational science, environmental modelling and medical imaging.
   Unfortunately, the diversity, scale and location of the required
   resources can present a, dilemma for the scientific worker because of
   the complexity of the underlying technology. As the scale of the
   scientific problem under investigation increases so does the nature of
   the scientist's interaction with the supporting infrastructure. The
   increased distribution of people and resources within a grid-based
   environment can make resource sharing and collaborative interaction a
   critical factor to their success. Unless the technological barriers
   affecting user accessibility are reduced, there is a danger that the
   only scientists to benefit will be those with reasonably high levels of
   computer literacy. This paper examines a number of important human
   factors of user interaction with the grid and expresses this in the
   context of the science undertaken by RealityGrid, a project funded by
   the UK e-Science programme. Critical user interaction issues will also
   be highlighted by comparing grid computational steering with supervisory
   control systems for local and remote access to the scientific
   environment. Finally, implications for future grid developers will be
   discussed with a particular emphasis on how to improve the scientists'
   access to what will be an increasingly important resource.}},

Abstract = {{This article proposes and describes activity-oriented design

   consensus in the context of human-computer interaction (HCI) design

   accessibility. To this effect, a research prototype of an AODE is
   presented as a means to validate the proposition made. The research
   prototype integrates alternative design perspectives (e.g., user
   modeling, analytical HCI design, argumentation and critiquing) into an
   extensible design platform of interoperable computational modules to
   implement a method toward accessibility, which is best suited to
   specification-oriented user interface development practices. Using the
   reference scenario, this article describes how the prototype AODE
   facilitates a seamless bridge between design and development activities
   through articulating shared representations of design knowledge and
   compiling recommendations, which can be directly interpreted and applied

Abstract = {{The web-based application by VoiceXML service on the Internet is
   gradually accepted for human-machine interaction because it provides the
   speech-enabled functionality and makes the telephone access a reality.
   However, it is not cost efficient to build voice only stand-alone web
   implementation and is more reasonable that voice interfaces should be
   retrofitted to be compatible or collaborated with the existing HTML or
   XML based web applications. Therefore, this paper considers that the
   functionality of the web site should enable multiple access modalities
   so that human beings can perceive and interact with either visual or
   speech response simultaneously. Under this principle, our research
   develops an integrated web based Mandarin dialog system which adopts
   ASR, TTS, VoiceXML browser, and VoIP technologies to create user
   friendly interfaces of GUI and VUI. The users can use either traditional
   telephone, cellular phone connection, or even VoIP by personal computer
   to interact with the VoiceXML server. In the mean time, the users browse
   the web and access the same content. The prototype system shows
   excellent performance and can be easily implemented into e-commerce
   ordering service for wide accessibility.}},

Title = {{Bridging the gap between structural bioinformatics and receptor
   research: The membrane-embedded, ligand-gated, P2X glycoprotein receptor}},
Journal = {{CURRENT TOPICS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{1657-1705}},
Abstract = {{Motivation: No details on P2X receptor architecture had been known at
   the atomic resolution level. Using comparative homology-based molecular
   modelling and threading, it was attempted to predict the
   three-dimensional structure of P2X receptors. This prediction could not
   be carried out, however, because important properties of the P2X family
   differ considerably from that of the potential template proteins. This
   paper reviews an alternative approach consisting of three research
   fields: bioinformatics, structural modelling, and a variety of the
   results of biological experiments.
   Model: Starting point is the amino acid sequence. Using the sequential
   data, the first step is a secondary structure prediction. The resulting
   secondary structure is converted into a three-dimensional geometry.
   Then, the secondary and tertiary structures are optimized by using the
   quantum chemistry RHF/3-21G minimal basic set and the all-atom molecular
   mechanics AMBER96 force field. The fold of the membrane-embedded protein
   is simulated by a suitable dielectricum. The structure is refined using
   a conjugate gradient minimizer (Fletcher-Reeves modification of the
   Polak-Ribiere method). The results of the geometry optimization were
   checked by a Ramanchandran plot, rotamer analysis, all-atom contact
   dots, and the C(beta) deviation. As additional tools for the model
   building, multiple alignment analysis and comparative sequence-function
   analysis were used. The approach is exemplified on the
   membrane-embedded, ligand-gated P2X3 receptor subunit, a
   monovalent-bivalent cation channel-forming glycoprotein that is
   activated by extracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate. From these
   results, a topology of the pore-forming motif of the P2X3 receptor
   subunit was proposed. It is believed that a fully functional P2X channel
   requires a precise coupling between (i) two distinct peptide modules, an
   extracellularly occuring ATP-binding module and a pore module that
   includes a long transmembrane and short intracellular part, (ii) an
   interaction surface with membranes, and (iii) hydrogen bonding forces of
   the residues and hydrated cations. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates
   the role of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) in P2X
   research (calcium ion permeability of the wild-type and after
   site-directed mutagenesis of the rat P2X2 receptor protein, KN-62
   analogs as competitive antagonists of the human P2X7 receptor).
   Experimental proofs: The predictions are experimentally testable and may
   provide an additional interpretation of experimental observations
   published in literature. In particular, there is the good agreement of
   the geometry optimized P2X3 structure with experimentally proposed P2X
   receptor models obtained by neurophysiological, biochemical,
   pharmacological, and mutation experiments. Although the rat P2X3
   receptor subunit is more complex (397 amino acids) than the KcsA protein
   (160 amino acids), the overall folds of the peptide backbone atoms are
   similar.
   Limitations: To avoid semantic confusion, it should be noted that
   ``prediction{''} is defined in a probabilistic sense. Matches to generic
   rules do not mean ``this is true{''} but rather ``this might be
   true{''}. Only biological and chemical knowledge can determine whether
   or not these predictions are meaningful. Thus, the results from the
   computational tools are probabilistic predictions and subject to further
   experimental verification.
   Availability: The geometry optimized P2X3 receptor subunit is freely
   available for academic researchers on e-mail request (PDB format).}},

   users, and that is a fact we cannot ignore. Human society is full of
   diversity and that must be reflected in human-computer interaction
   design. Thus, we need to engage users in a new kind of interaction
   concept where user interfaces are tailored-made, and where user
   interfaces are intelligent and adaptive. A new generation of
   specification techniques is necessary to face these challenges
   successfully. Model-based design has proved to be a powerful tool to
   achieve these goals. A first step towards adaptive user interface
   generation is introduced by means of the concept of connector applied to
   model-based design of user interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Training applications which use responsive virtual-human technology
   (RVHT) - training tools based on sophisticated voice recognition and
   behavior modeling technologies - have great potential for improving
   training of interaction skills essential to effective interviewing, such
   as refusal avoidance, probing, and addressing questions related to
   informed consent. However, our understanding of how to model the
   behavior of responsive virtual humans and how people interact with them
   is limited. The overall effectiveness of this technology as a training
   tool depends upon its ability to provide appropriate learning
   experiences, its ability to engage the student, and its acceptability to
   disparate users. This research assesses the accessibility and acceptance
   of a training application based on RVHT as a tool for teaching refusal
   avoidance skills to telephone interviewers. The assessment focuses on
   users' ability to understand the basic features of the application,
   whether diverse users are able to use the application equally, how users
   react to problems, whether the virtual humans are realistic enough for
   the users, and ultimately, whether users accept the virtual environment

Abstract = {{In order to increase accessibility to electronic commerce applications,
   an overall reduction in the complexity of interactions with computerized
   systems is required. This paper describes an architecture that uses
   personalization information to customize interactions with end-users in
   a way that reduces interaction complexity. The storage and manipulation
   of personal information under the control of the end-user for the
   dynamic customization of interactions requires a paradigm shift from the
   client-server model of computing to the more General peer-to-peer model.
   In this paper, the existing three-tier architecture is extended with a
   new, human-centric layer that is configurable by domain experts who are
   not necessarily computer science or computer engineering professionals,
   allowing for a `technology pull' approach to the configuration of
   systems. The human-centric layer will support a process-oriented
   peer-to-peer interaction paradigm and will use existing middleware
   services for access to network services and legacy systems. This paper
   focuses on the conceptual model and the functional framework of this new
   human-centric layer. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Incorporation of speech and Indian scripts can greatly enhance the
   accessibility of web information among common people. This paper
   describes a `web reader' which `reads out' the textual contents of a
   selected web page in Hindi or in English with Indian accent. The content
   of the page is downloaded and parsed into suitable textual form. It is
   then passed on to an indigenously developed text-to-speech system for
   Hindi/Indian English, to generate spoken output. The text-to-speech
   conversion is performed in three stages: text analysis, to establish
   pronunciation, phoneme to acoustic-phonetic parameter conversion and,
   lastly, parameter-to-speech conversion through a production model.
   Different types of voices are used to read special messages. The web
   reader detects the hypertext links in the web pages and gives the user
   the option to follow the link or continue perusing the current web page.
   The user can exercise the option either through a keyboard or via spoken
   commands. Future plans include refining the web parser, improvement of
   naturalness of synthetic speech and improving the robustness of the

   departments. This lack is despite the fact that the HCI literature shows
   an ever-increasing concern with design of artefacts. Also, design
   educators frequently refer to the need for more training in user-centred
   design in order for both students and practising designers to be able to
   create products and systems for the information age. In the new world of
   digital as well as tangible objects, of virtual products and services,
   the theme of usability and accessibility that are central to HCI offer a
   rich pool of knowledge. This paper explores some of the HCI topics that
   can be of use to design students and describes how they are to be

Abstract = {{Computers and the Internet as a worldwide communications network are
   bringing profound change in our way of life. Computers, like other new
   technologies, create new possibilities. The new information cyberspace
   augments individuals' accomplishment space to a large extend in
   condition of providing equal opportunity of access to the information
   cyberspace for all individuals. This cyberspace revolution is changing
   the human condition in fundamental ways. Those changes have the
   potential to reduce differences between disabled and nondisabled
   individuals. The information cyberspace revolution has the potential to
   ``level the playing field{''} for individuals with disabilities with
   respect to many kinds of jobs and other activities. In this paper, we
   analyze the concept of disability and the special needs of people with
   disabilities to have equal access to the information cyberspace. The
   main concepts of communication, tool and infrastructure are introduced.
   We also present one of the interesting solutions aiming at providing
   access for everyone to all computers: the Total Access System (TAS);
   developed through the Archimedes Project at Stanford University. The
   main contribution of this paper is our suggestion to enhance the TAS by
   complementing it with an intelligent component: an anthropomorphic
   intelligent agent that can work as an intelligent interface supporting
   the functionality of TAS. The design criteria of responsiveness,
   competence, and accessibility for the suggested Intelligent Interface
   Agent are given.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the contribution of adaptive techniques to
   Universal Access in Human-Computer Interaction. To this effect, the
   paper revisits the concept of Universal Access, briefly reviews relevant

   and environment-level adaptation-based approaches, to more generic
   solutions oriented towards Universal Access. Finally, the paper
   highlights some of the research challenges ahead. The normative
   perspective of the paper is that adaptive techniques in the context of
   Universal Access have the potential to facilitate both accessibility and
   high quality interaction, for the broadest possible end-user population.
   This implies the design of systems that undertake context-sensitive
   processing so as to manifest their functional core in alternative
   interactive embodiments suitable for different users, usage patterns and

Abstract = {{With the advancement of technology and the information explosion,
   integration of the two into performance aiding systems can have a
   significant impact on operational and maintenance environments. The
   Department of Defense and commercial industry have made great strides in
   digitizing and automating technical manuals and data to be presented on
   performance aiding systems. These performance aides are computerized
   interactive systems that provide procedures on how to operate and
   maintain fielded systems. The idea is to provide the end-user a system
   which is compatible with their work environment.
   The purpose of this paper is to show, historically, the progression of
   wearable computer aiding systems for maintenance environments, and then
   highlight the work accomplished in the design and development of
   glasses-mounted displays (GMD). The paper reviews work performed over
   the last seven years, then highlights, through review of a usability
   study, the advances made with GMDs. The use of portable computing
   systems, such as laptop and notebook computers, does not necessarily
   increase the accessibility of the displayed information while
   accomplishing a given task in a hands-busy, mobile work environment. The
   use of a GMD increases accessibility of the information by placing it in
   eye sight of the user without obstructing the surrounding environment.
   Although the potential utility for this type of display is great,
   hardware and human integration must be refined. Results from the
   usability study show the usefulness and usability of the GMD in a
   mobile, hands-free environment.}},

Abstract = {{Certain design projects raise difficult user-interface problems that are
   not easily amenable to designers' intuition or rapid prototyping due to
   their novelty, conceptual complexity, and the difficulty of conducting
   appropriate user studies. Interpersonal access control in
   computer-mediated communication (CMC) systems is just such a problem. We
   describe a collection of systematic theory-based analyses of a system
   prototype that inherited its control mechanism from two preexisting
   systems. We demonstrate that the collective use of system and user
   modeling techniques provides insight into this complex design problem
   and enables us to examine the implications of design decisions for users
   and implementation. The analyses identify a number of weaknesses in the
   prototype and are used to propose ways of making substantive refinements
   to improve its simplicity and appropriateness for two tasks: altering
   one's accessibility and distinguishing between who can make what kinds
   of connections. We conclude with a discussion of some critical issues
   that are relevant for CMC systems, and reflect on the process of
   applying formal human-computer interaction (HCI) techniques in informal,
   exploratory design contexts.}},

Abstract = {{The bovine IgG1 and IgG2 isotypes exhibit large differences in effector
   functions. To examine the structural basis for this, the 12-domain
   structures of IgG1 and IgG2 were investigated by pulsed neutron
   scattering using a recently developed camera L0Q. This method reports on
   the average relative disposition in solution of the Fab and Fe fragments
   in IgG. The radii of gyration (R(G)) were found to be similar at 5.64
   and 5.71 nm for IgG1 and IgG2 respectively in 100\% (H2O)-H-2 buffers.
   The two cross-sectional radii of gyration (R(XS)) were also similar at
   2.38-2.41 and 0.98-1.02 nm. Similar values were obtained for porcine
   IgG. Both bovine IgG1 and IgG2 possess similar overall solution
   structures, despite sequence differences at the hinge region at the
   centre of their structures. An automated computer survey of possible IgG
   structures was developed, in which coordinates for the two Fab fragments
   were displaced in a two-dimensional plane relative to those of the Fc
   fragment in 0.25 nm steps. The scattering curves calculated from these
   structures were found to be sensitive to relative displacements of the
   three fragments, but not on their rotational orientation about their
   longest axes. Good agreement with the solution scattering data was
   obtained with a planar IgG model in which the C-terminus of the C(H)1
   domain of Fab was 3.6 nm from the N-terminus of Fc in both IgG1 and
   IgG2, with a precision of 0.7 nm. Energy refinement showed that this
   spatial separation is compatible with the hinge sequences of bovine IgG1
   and IgG2. The results show that multidomain protein structures can be
   modelled using L0Q data, and that a long hinge sequence does not
   necessarily reflect a large distance between Fab and Fc. The steric
   accessibility of Fc sites for interactions with cell-surface Fc
   receptors and Clq of complement is shown to be generally similar for
   IgG1 and IgG2, and the difference in effector function between IgG1 and
   IgG2 is probably based on deletions in the IgG2 hinge sequence.}},

Abstract = {{A spoken language system combines speech recognition, natural language
   processing and human interface technology. It functions by recognizing
   the person's words, interpreting the sequence of words to obtain a
   meaning in terms of the application, and providing an appropriate
   response back to the user. Potential applications of spoken language
   systems range from simple tasks, such as retrieving information from an
   existing database (traffic reports, airline schedules), to interactive
   problem solving tasks involving complex planning and reasoning (travel
   planning, traffic routing), to support for multilingual interactions. We
   examine eight key areas in which basic research is needed to produce
   spoken language systems: 1) robust speech recognition; 2) automatic
   training and adaptation; 3) spontaneous speech; 4) dialogue models; 5)
   natural language response generation; 6) speech synthesis and speech
   generation; 7) multilingual systems; and 8) interactive multimodal
   systems. In each area, we identify key research challenges, the
   infrastructure needed to support research, and the expected benefits.
   We conclude by reviewing the need for multidisciplinary research, for
   development of shared corpora and related resources, for computational
   support and for. rapid communication among researchers. The successful
   development of this technology will increase accessibility of computers
   to a wide range of users, will facilitate multinational communication
   and trade, and will create new research specialties and jobs in this
   rapidly expanding area.}},

Abstract = {{New I/O devices with data rates ranging from 10 to 100 Mbytes per second
   are becoming available for personal computers and workstations. These
   include human-interaction devices for video capture and display (and
   audio record and playback), high-capacity storage devices, and
   high-speed network communication devices. These devices have enabled
   I/O-intensive applications for desktop computing that require input,
   processing, and output of very large amounts of data. This article
   focuses on an important aspect of operating system support for these
   applications: efficient transfer of large data objects between the
   protection domains in which processes and devices reside.
   Many operating systems are inefficient in transferring large amounts of
   data between domains. Most of them, even when they try to avoid physical
   copying, offer a data-transfer model that assumes a need for complete
   accessibility to all transferred data. This assumption leads to
   overheads that can other wise be avoided. The authors' design for an
   interdomain transfer facility (which was inspired by the
   `'container-shipping'' solution from the cargo-transportation industry)
   is based on virtual transfers and avoids all unnecessary physical
   copying.}},

Abstract = {{We have characterized the amino acid sequences of over 20 endogenous
   peptides bound by a soluble analog of H-2D(d), H-2D(s)d. Synthetic
   analogs corresponding to self, viral, tumor, or motif peptides were then
   tested for their ability to bind to H-2D(d) by serologic epitope
   induction assays using both purified soluble protein and cell surface
   H-2D(d). The dominant primary sequence motif included glycine at
   position 2, proline at position 3, and a hydrophobic COOH terminus:
   leucine, isoleucine, or phenylalanine at position 9 or 10. Ancillary
   support for high affinity binding was contributed by a positively
   charged residue at position 5. Three-dimensional computer models of
   H-2D(s)d/peptide complexes, based on the crystallographic structure of
   the human HLA-B27/peptide complex, showed that the basic residue at
   position 5 was in position to form a salt bridge with aspartic acid at
   position 156, a polymorphic residue of the H-2D(d) heavy (H) chain.
   Analysis of 28 such models, including 17 based on nonamer self-peptides,
   revealed considerable variation in the structure of the major
   histocompatibility complex (MHC) surrounding peptide residue 1,
   depending on the size and charge of the side chain. Interactions between
   the side chains of peptide residues 5 and 7, and 6 and 8 commonly
   occurred. Those peptide positions with limited sequence variability and
   least solvent accessibility may satisfy structural requirements for high
   affinity binding of the peptide to the MHC class I H chain, whereas the
   highly variable positions of the peptide (such as positions 4, 6, and 8)
   may contribute more to the T cell epitopes.}},

Abstract = {{Optical Character Recognition (OCR) has become a highly demanded
   information transfer technology in recent years. This demand has been
   driven by the increasing needs for information sharing and office
   automation, and by the increasing accessibility to large-scale, fast,
   and powerful computer resources. A problem of current OCR technology is
   that texts produced by the state-of-the-art OCR software contain an
   unacceptable frequency of errors. This prevents the OCR technology from
   being efficiently used for vast-volume information transfer or daily
   office operation applications. To correct these errors in a conventional
   way requires a significant amount of costly human-machine interaction.
   In this article, we identify and classify the types and distributions of
   optical recognition errors. We propose a novel postprocessing strategy,
   based on machine learning techniques, to correct errors resulted from
   unrecognized or misrecognized characters during the recognition process.
   By applying this strategy, the accuracy of recognition can be
   significantly improved, and the human interaction required can be
   dramatically reduced. Experimental results indicate that, in a typical
   environment, about 46\% of total errors can be corrected automatically
   (i.e., without human interference), with an accuracy of 91\%.}},

   oligoribonucleotide analogues of rabbit alpha-globin mRNA were
   synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase from a synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide

   possess varying degrees of cap accessibility and secondary structure.
   Equilibrium association constants for the interaction of these
